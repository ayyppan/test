<P><E T="B">Serum autoantibodies to the glycolytic enzyme enolase have been reported in a diverse range of inflammatory, degenerative, and psychiatric disorders. Diseases in which these antibodies have been reported in high incidence include autoimmune polyglandular syndrome type 1 &lpar;80&percnt;, 35 of 44&rpar;, primary &lpar;69&percnt;, 60 of 87&rpar;, and secondary &lpar;58&percnt;, 14 of 24&rpar; membranous nephropathy, cancer&hyphen;associated retinopathy &lpar;68.8&percnt;, 11 of 16&rpar;, autoimmune hepatitis type 1 &lpar;60&percnt;, 12 of 20&rpar;, mixed cryoglobulinemia with renal involvement &lpar;63.6&percnt;, seven of 11&rpar;, cystoid macular edema &lpar;60&percnt;, six of 10&rpar;, and endometriosis &lpar;50&percnt;, 21 of 41&rpar;. In autoimmune polyglandular syndrome type 1 patients, all had chronic mucocutaneous candidiasis with demonstrated antibody reactivity to candida enolase, which is suggestive of cross reactivity or epitope mimicry. Formation of autoantibodies to enolase may be a normal process, with reported incidence in apparently healthy subjects ranging from 0&percnt; &lpar;zero of 91&rpar; to 11.7&percnt; &lpar;seven of 60&rpar;. Nonetheless, we suggest that excessive production of these autoantibodies, which are generated as a consequence of uptake of enolase by antigen&hyphen;presenting cells and subsequent B cell activation, can potentially initiate tissue injury as a result of immune complex deposition.</E></P></ABS></AB>

<P>One of the characteristic features of an autoimmune response is the increased incidence and production of circulating autoantibodies. To date, autoantibody reactivities to a variety of molecular and cellular targets have been identified and characterized. These autoantibodies typically segregate with particular systemic or organ&hyphen;specific autoimmune diseases and are, therefore, useful as diagnostic &ldquo;markers&rdquo; of these diseases. In systemic autoimmune disorders, these antibodies are usually directed against ubiquitous target antigens. In contrast, in organ&hyphen;specific autoimmune endocrinopathies the associated autoantibodies are typically restricted to the affected organ or endocrine gland. Despite the disease associations of autoantibodies, the exact mechanisms of their generation and their role in disease pathogenesis remain obscure.</P>
<P>Enzymes appear to be prime targets for autoimmune responses. Circulating autoantibodies reactive to a widely distributed antigen, the glycolytic enzyme enolase, have recently been increasingly reported in the sera of patients with a variety of diseases&semi; however, the genesis and function of these autoantibodies are not known. Here we review antienolase autoantibodies with particular emphasis on their clinical relevance, origins, and disease associations.</P></LV1>
<LV1><HD><E T="B">ENOLASE</E></HD>
<P>The glycolytic enzyme enolase &lpar;2&hyphen;phospho&hyphen;D&hyphen;glycerate hydrolase&rpar; is a member of a superfamily of enzymes related by their ability to catalyze abstraction of the &agr;&hyphen;proton of a carboxylic acid to form an enolic intermediate.<LK IDREF="R1-1">1</LK> Enolase exists as a homo&hyphen; and heterodimer in all eukaryotes and some prokaryotes, and it catalyzes the conversion of 2&hyphen;phosphoglycerate in a dehydration step that yields phosphoenolpyruvate in the eighth step of a set of reactions that converts one molecule of glucose into two molecules of pyruvate and two molecules of adenosine triphosphate.</P>
<P>In higher eukaryotes, three distinct isoforms of enolase &lpar;&agr;, &bgr;, and &ggr;&rpar; are present, all encoded by separate genes.<LK IDREF="R2-1">2</LK> The &agr; isoform appears ubiquitously expressed in all tissues examined to date, whereas expression of the &bgr; isoform appears restricted to muscle and &ggr; enolase is expressed primarily in neurons.<LK IDREF="R3-1 R4-1">3,4</LK> In addition to its contribution to anaerobic glycolysis, enolase has been identified as a product of several types of tumors, and its enzymatic activity has been detected in the sera of some cancer patients.<LK IDREF="R5-1 R6-1 R7-1 R8-1 R9-1">5&ndash;9</LK> Non&hyphen;neuronal enolase has been reported to act as a hypoxic stress protein<LK IDREF="R10-1 R11-1 R12-1">10&ndash;12</LK> and to form a complex with RNase E of <E T="I">Escherichia coli</E> degradosome.<LK IDREF="R13-1 R14-1">13,14</LK></P></LV1>

<LV1><HD><E T="B">AUTOIMMUNE POLYGLANDULAR SYNDROME TYPE 1</E></HD>
<P>To date patients with APS 1, presenting with chronic candidal infection, demonstrate the tightest association of disease with enolase&hyphen;reactive antibodies.<LK IDREF="R15-1">15</LK> In these patients, the production of antibodies reactive to enolase is most likely a consequence of chronic candidiasis. Peterson et al<LK IDREF="R15-1">15</LK> reported that 84&percnt; &lpar;37 of 44&rpar; of APS 1 patients with chronic mucocutaneous candidiasis produce antibodies reactive to candidal enolase. <E T="I">Candida albicans</E> enolase &lpar;GenBank L04943&rpar; shares 65&percnt; identity with human &agr;&hyphen;enolase, hence anticandidal enolase antibodies are likely to cross&hyphen;react with human enolase. It is, therefore, conceivable that the association of enolase&hyphen;reactive autoantibodies with autoimmune polyglandular syndrome type 1 &lpar;APS 1&rpar; is a consequence of epitope mimicry.</P></LV1>
<LV1><HD><E T="B">SYSTEMIC AUTOIMMUNE DISEASES AND KIDNEY DISORDERS</E></HD>
<P>Anti&hyphen;&agr;&hyphen;enolase autoantibodies in the sera of patients with systemic lupus erythematosus &lpar;SLE&rpar;, particularly those with renal disease, were first reported by Moodie et al.<LK IDREF="R25-1">25</LK> More recently, Pratesi et al<LK IDREF="R28-1">28</LK> found anti&hyphen;&agr;&hyphen;enolase autoantibodies in 27&percnt; of SLE patients &lpar;most with active renal disease&rpar; &lpar;nine of 33&rpar; and in 30&percnt; of patients with systemic sclerosis &lpar;six of 20&rpar;. They also detected anti&hyphen;&agr;&hyphen;enolase antibodies in 30&percnt; of mixed cryoglobulinemia &lpar;MC&rpar; and nephritis patients &lpar;six of 19&rpar;&semi; however, these autoantibodies were not detected in MC patients without renal involvement. These findings led Pratesi et al<LK IDREF="R28-1">28</LK> to postulate that in SLE and MC antienolase autoantibodies associate with nephritis. Autoantibodies to &agr;&hyphen;enolase in seven of 11 patients with MC and renal involvement have also been reported by Sabbatini et al.<LK IDREF="R21-1">21</LK> In an independent study, Wakui et al<LK IDREF="R17-1">17</LK> detected anti&hyphen;&agr;&hyphen;enolase autoantibodies of IgG<SB>1</SB> and IgG<SB>3</SB> subclasses in patients with another kidney disorder, membranous nephropathy &lpar;MN&rpar;. They detected these antibodies in sera of 69&percnt; of patients with primary MN &lpar;60 of 87&rpar; and in 58&percnt; of patients with secondary MN &lpar;14 of 24&rpar;. Among patients with secondary MN, antienolase antibodies were detected in 67&percnt; &lpar;10 of 15&rpar; of patients with rheumatoid arthritis and in 44&percnt; of SLE patients &lpar;four of nine&rpar;.<LK IDREF="R17-1">17</LK></P>
<P>We have previously reported on a patient with discoid lupus erythematosus and chronic lymphocytic leukemia, and we identified enolase as one of the major antigens detected by immunoblotting with this patient's serum.<LK IDREF="R27-1">27</LK> The major subclass of these antienolase autoantibodies was identified as IgG<SB>1</SB>. Lupus is characterized by abnormalities in humoral immunity, and the detection of a variety of autoantibodies with different specificities is common to this disorder. In light of these facts, it may not be surprising to find enolase&hyphen;reactive autoantibodies present in some lupus patients.</P></LV1>

<P>Adamus et al<LK IDREF="R18-1">18</LK> have identified autoantibodies to retinal enolase in the serum of 11 of 16 patients with cancer and cancer&hyphen;associated retinopathy &lpar;CAR&rpar; syndrome. The dominant autoantibodies reactive to enolase in CAR patients were also of IgG<SB>1</SB> isotype. In identification of the autoantigen, Adamus et al did not obtain N&hyphen;terminal amino acid sequence from purified bovine retinal enolase, presumably because of posttranslational modifications. Nevertheless, the amino acid sequence of selected peptide fragments generated with CNBr and endoproteinase LysC revealed high homology to human &agr;&hyphen;enolase. Autoantibodies from patients with cancer and CAR syndrome are reactive to four isoelectric forms of enolase &lpar;pI &ap;5.9&hyphen;7.1&rpar;. Sera from CAR syndrome patients frequently immunoblotted other proteins in addition to the 47&hyphen;kd enolase antigen.<LK IDREF="R18-1">18</LK> In a subsequent report, Adamus et al<LK IDREF="R30-1">30</LK> examined the fine specificity and cytotoxic effects of anti&hyphen;&agr;&hyphen;enolase autoantibodies. The researchers mapped three binding regions on the enolase molecule common to anti&hyphen;&agr;&hyphen;enolase antibodies from CAR patients and normal subjects as well as an epitope specific to pathogenic CAR sera. They demonstrated that antienolase antibodies from CAR patients induced apoptosis in cultured retinal cells, which suggests a potential mechanism for retinal degradation associated with cancer.</P>
<P>There have been two recent reports of autoantibodies reactive to enolase in non&hyphen;cancer&hyphen;associated retinopathies.<LK IDREF="R19-1 R20-1">19,20</LK> Maruyama et al<LK IDREF="R19-1">19</LK> found 25.3&percnt; &lpar;20 of 79&rpar; glaucoma patients &lpar;6 of 23 patients with normal tension glaucoma and 14 of 56 patients with primary open angle glaucoma&rpar; had serum reactivity to a 50&hyphen;kd band in two&hyphen;dimensional polyacrylamide gels, identified as enolase by a combination of in&hyphen;gel digestion and Edman sequencing. Wolfensberger et al<LK IDREF="R20-1">20</LK> found that six &lpar;60&percnt;&rpar; of 10 patients with cystoid macular edema had these antibodies.</P></LV1>

<P>Autoantibodies against &agr;&hyphen;enolase have been described in 28.6&percnt; of patients with primary biliary cirrhosis &lpar;16 of 56&rpar; and in 31.6&percnt; of patients with autoimmune hepatitis &lpar;six of 19&rpar;.<LK IDREF="R24-1">24</LK> Endometriosis patients have also been reported to have antienolase reactivities.<LK IDREF="R22-1">22</LK> In addition, Rattner et al<LK IDREF="R16-1">16</LK> reported autoantibodies reactive to the centrosome in two patients with no evidence of systemic rheumatic disease. Patient 1 was a 30&hyphen;year&hyphen;old, white female presenting with hyperthyroidism and vague aches and pains, and patient 2 was a 32&hyphen;year&hyphen;old, white female presenting with Raynaud phenomenon with no periungual vascular changes on capillaroscopy. Immunoblotting and affinity purification studies suggested that the antigen was enolase.<LK IDREF="R16-1">16</LK></P></LV1>

<P>Moodie et al<LK IDREF="R25-1">25</LK> have identified &agr;&hyphen;enolase as an autoantigen reactive with antineutrophil cytoplasmic antibodies &lpar;ANCA&rpar; in vasculitis patients. They report nearly 40&percnt; &lpar;22 of 59&rpar; of patients with clinically proven vasculitis have antibodies to &agr;&hyphen;enolase present in cytosolic extracts of neutrophils, which suggests that antibody response in ANCA&hyphen;positive vasculitis is not restricted to neutrophil granules. Subsequent reports by Orth et al<LK IDREF="R23-1">23</LK> and Roozendaal et al<LK IDREF="R29-1">29</LK> support those of Moodie et al.<LK IDREF="R25-1">25</LK> In 27&percnt; &lpar;four of 15&rpar; of ANCA patients with primary sclerosing cholangitis, a chronic cholestatic liver disease, Orth et al<LK IDREF="R23-1">23</LK> identified &agr;&hyphen;enolase as a target autoantigen. Roozendaal et al<LK IDREF="R29-1">29</LK> report detection of ANCA reactive to &agr;&hyphen;enolase in 10&percnt; of patients with ulcerative colitis &lpar;10 of 96&rpar; and in 18&percnt; of patients with Crohn's disease &lpar;20 of 112&rpar;.</P></LV1>

<P>The first report of autoantibodies to the glycolytic enzyme enolase &lpar;ie, neuron&hyphen;specific enolase&rpar; was in psychiatric patients.<LK IDREF="R26-1">26</LK> Autoantibodies to neuron&hyphen;specific enolase have also been observed in patients with Alzheimer disease &lpar;12 of 32 patients&rpar; and least frequently in patients with alcoholic syndrome &lpar;three of 78&rpar; in comparison with healthy subjects &lpar;2 of 112&rpar;.</P></LV1>
<LV1><HD><E T="B">OCCURRENCE OF ANTIENOLASE AUTOANTIBODIES IN APPARENTLY HEALTHY SUBJECTS</E></HD>
<P>Autoimmunity is defined by presence of self&hyphen;reactive lymphocytes. Tolerance is a state of antigen&hyphen;induced nonresponsiveness of lymphocytes achieved by clonal deletion, suppression, or anergy&semi; however, the formation of self&hyphen;reactive antibodies and T cells may be a normal physiological process. Autoantibodies with the capacity to bind to self&hyphen;antigens are common in sera of normal individuals in the absence of any discernible disease.<LK IDREF="R31-1 R32-1">31,32</LK> Physiological autoimmune responses may play a role in maintenance of homeostasis by elimination of degraded self&hyphen;antigens. These autoantibodies usually have low titers and poor affinity for their cognate autoantigens, and they belong mainly to the IgM class, although some natural IgGs and IgAs have also been described.<LK IDREF="R33-1 R34-1">33,34</LK> It seems reasonable, therefore, that the occurrence of autoantibodies reactive to enolase is a normal process. Indeed, the reported incidence of enolase&hyphen;reactive antibodies in apparently healthy subjects ranges from 0&percnt; &lpar;zero of 91&rpar; to 11.7&percnt; &lpar;seven of 60&rpar; &lpar;<LK IDREF="T2-1">Table 2</LK>&rpar;. The excessive production of these autoantibodies can lead to pathologies. Elevated serum levels of &ggr;&hyphen;enolase have been reported in patients with neuroblastoma, small&hyphen;cell carcinoma, and lung tumors.<LK IDREF="R9-1">9</LK> Surprisingly, there have been no studies to date that report on the incidence of enolase&hyphen;reactive autoantibodies in this patient cohort.</P>

<LV1><HD><E T="B">AUTOANTIBODIES REACTIVE TO OTHER GLYCOLYTIC ENZYMES</E></HD>
<P>Generally, we tend to view the cells' cytoplasm as a &ldquo;soup&rdquo; that contains heterologous enzymes with key organelles that are tethered to cytoskeletal proteins. Yet, recently there has been interest in understanding the relationship between location of heterologous proteins in the cytoplasm, their interactions, and physiological functions. There is emerging evidence that glycolytic enzymes may be distributed spatially as functional clusters throughout the cytoplasm.<LK IDREF="R35-1 R36-1 R37-1">35&ndash;37</LK> Spatial proximity of the centromere proteins &lpar;CENPs&rpar;, particularly CENPs A, B, and C, is often cited as a possible explanation of why sera collected from systemic sclerosis patients contains autoantibodies with heterologous reactivities to multiple CENPs.<LK IDREF="R38-1 R39-1">38,39</LK> There have been few reports of autoantibodies to other glycolytic enzymes. Autoantibodies to aldolase have been reported in patients with acute and chronic hepatitis at significantly higher levels than in chronic carriers of hepatitis B, patients with rubella or cytomegalovirus infections, or in healthy subjects.<LK IDREF="R40-1">40</LK> Triosephosphate isomerase&hyphen;reactive autoantibodies are detectable in sera of patients with acute Epstein&hyphen;Barr virus and <E T="I">Plasmodium falciparum</E> infections.<LK IDREF="R41-1 R42-1">41,42</LK> The authors suggest that these IgM autoantibodies may contribute to hemolytic anemia in infectious mononucleosis and malaria. Autoantibodies reactive to a glycolytic enzyme, glucose&hyphen;6&hyphen;phosphate isomerase, have been reported in K&sol;BxN T cell receptor transgenic mice that spontaneously develop a joint disorder with many clinical, histological, and immunological features characteristic of rheumatoid arthritis in humans.<LK IDREF="R43-1">43</LK> Whether enolase&hyphen;reactive autoantibodies, or even reactivities, to other glycolytic enzymes are likely to occur in concert will require further investigation.</P></LV1>
<LV1><HD><E T="B">ORIGIN OF ANTIENOLASE AUTOANTIBODIES</E></HD>
<P>The mechanism by which autoantibodies arise remains obscure. Increasingly, enzymes have been identified as targets of autoimmune responses.<LK IDREF="R44-1 R45-1">44,45</LK> Unlike other autoantibodies that segregate with a particular set of diseases of presumptive autoimmune origin, antienolase autoantibodies have been reported in a broad spectrum of autoimmune as well as nonautoimmune diseases. On the basis of contemporary knowledge of immunology, we propose the following scenario for the genesis of these autoantibodies &lpar;<LK IDREF="F1-1">Figure 1</LK>&rpar;. Given that enolase is a widely distributed cytosolic enzyme, we propose that it is taken up by tissue&hyphen;resident antigen&hyphen;presenting cells after the cell death that accompanies normal cell turnover. Given that non&hyphen;neuronal enolase has been reported to act as a hypoxic stress protein<LK IDREF="R10-1 R11-1 R12-1">10&ndash;12</LK> and can form complexes with RNase E of degradosomes,<LK IDREF="R13-1 R14-1">13,14</LK> it is conceivable that these events may also act as triggers for the uptake of enolase by antigen&hyphen;presenting cells. It is further possible with some pathologies, for example, APS 1 and chronic candida infection, that coincidental or causative of the autoimmune disease, candida enolase is taken up by antigen&hyphen;presenting cells. It is also conceivable that a proinflammatory milieu generated by the diverse range of pathologies associated with antienolase antibodies or incidental infections in otherwise healthy individuals results in activation of antigen&hyphen;presenting cells.<LK IDREF="R46-1">46</LK> Activated antigen&hyphen;presenting cells migrate to secondary lymphoid organs, where they present processed enolase peptides to CD4 helper T cells, as well as to B cells, which leads to production of antienolase autoantibodies. These autoantibodies thereby arise as a consequence of a relaxation or breakdown of tolerance, or through molecular &lpar;sic epitope&rpar; mimicry between inherent and foreign molecules of enolase. Although it is conceivable that these autoantibodies are innocuous epiphenomena, we speculate that these autoantibodies may form immune complexes with enolase antigen, which results in deposition of immune complexes in tissues and leads to tissue damage and disease.</P>
<FG ID="F1-1" FILE="G1FF1"><P><E T="BIT">Figure 1</E> <E T="I">Model for genesis and clinical relevance of autoantibodies reactive to enolase. Enolase is taken up by tissue&hyphen;resident, antigen&hyphen;presenting cells after cell death that accompanies normal cell turnover &lpar;apoptosis&rpar;. Enolase released by necrotic cells in the aftermath of hypoxic stress may also be taken up by antigen&hyphen;presenting cells. In tissues with chronic candida infection, candida enolase may also be processed by antigen&hyphen;presenting cells. Activated antigen&hyphen;presenting cells migrate to draining lymph nodes or other secondary lymphoid organs, where they activate the na&iuml;ve T and B cells that target enolase. These antibodies may form immune complexes with enolase antigen, which results in deposition of immune complexes and leads to tissue damage and disease.</E></P></FG></LV1>
<LV1><HD><E T="B">CLINICAL RELEVANCE OF ANTIENOLASE AUTOANTIBODIES</E></HD>
<P>The clinical relevance of antienolase autoantibodies is not well known. An intriguing question is, why do enolase&hyphen;reactive autoantibodies associate with such a diverse spectrum of autoimmune as well as nonautoimmune diseases, encompassing inflammatory, degenerative, and psychiatric disorders&quest; In contrast, antinuclear autoantibodies, although reactive to multiple antigens, generally have a tighter association with specific forms of rheumatic disease.<LK IDREF="R47-1">47</LK> There is approximately equal incidence of antinuclear autoantibodies and antienolase antibodies in apparently healthy subjects<LK IDREF="R48-1">48</LK> &lpar;<LK IDREF="T2-1">Table 2</LK>&rpar;. The titers of antienolase antibodies in healthy and diseased subjects were not comprehensively investigated in the individual studies that report on these antibodies, and the variance in methodologies used in identifying these antibodies does not allow a direct comparison between studies. It seems reasonable, however, to speculate that antienolase antibodies would most likely be in higher titers and IgG classes in disease subjects compared with lower titers and the more frequent IgM class in healthy subjects. A more comprehensive study is needed to validate this assertion. As no unifying event is likely to initiate both autoimmune and nonautoimmune disease, the diversity in the spectrum of pathologies in which enolase&hyphen;reactive antibodies are detected implies that these antibodies most likely arise as a consequence of disease. Further, it appears that tolerance by self&hyphen;reactive lymphocytes to the ubiquitous protein enolase is prone to breakage, which results in autoantibody production. This raises the question about what particular features of the enolase protein make it more prone to targeting by the immune system than other ubiquitous proteins. The fact that enolase can act as a hypoxic stress protein<LK IDREF="R10-1 R11-1 R12-1">10&ndash;12</LK> and can form complexes with RNase E of degradosomes<LK IDREF="R13-1 R14-1">13,14</LK> may increase its chances of being taken up by antigen&hyphen;presenting cells. In the case of chronic candida infection, the levels of candidal enolase may result in an immune response to the foreign enolase antigen,<LK IDREF="R15-1">15</LK> which by epitope mimicry leads to targeting of inherent enolase, which is partly a consequence of the evolutionary conservation of this protein.<LK IDREF="R49-1">49</LK></P>
<P>To further our understanding of the origin and clinical relevance of enolase&hyphen;reactive autoantibodies, a number of key questions need to the addressed. These include the following&colon; the mechanism by which tolerance to enolase is broken&semi; whether autoimmunity to enolase is a consequence of or initiates a specific disease, or whether it occurs coincidentally with a variety of disease&semi; and the exact pathological roles played by enolase&hyphen;reactive autoantibodies in disease. The answers to these questions are likely to follow once further progress is made in our understanding of the molecular and immunological basis of the genesis of autoimmunity.</P></LV1></BD>

<ABS><HD><E T="BIT">Background&colon;</E></HD>
<P><E T="B">Silicosis, a pneumoconiosis marked by interstitial pulmonary fibrosis, is caused by inhalation of free crystalline silica particles. When silica particles are injected into the lower lung, they are translocated across the epithelium into the interstitial space, where macrophage&hyphen;derived growth factors affect lung fibroblast proliferation and collagen deposition. We hypothesized that silica may act directly on pulmonary fibroblasts modifying extracellular matrix &lpar;ECM&rpar; synthesis and that the effects of silica may be mediated by transforming growth factor&hyphen;&bgr; &lpar;TGF&bgr;&rpar; overproduction.</E></P></ABS>
<ABS><HD><E T="BIT">Methods&colon;</E></HD>
<P><E T="B">To test this hypothesis, we studied a human lung fibroblast cell line &lpar;WI&hyphen;1003&rpar; exposed to silica in vitro. We investigated cell morphology by electron microscopic procedure, cell growth, collagen production, and glycosaminoglycans &lpar;GAG&rpar; composition by radiolabeled precursors. Cytokine and growth factor synthesis were evaluated by specific enzyme&hyphen;linked immunoadsorbent assay kits and Northern blotting analysis.</E></P></ABS>
<ABS><HD><E T="BIT">Results&colon;</E></HD>
<P><E T="B">Pulmonary fibroblasts internalized silica particles without detectable cell damage. Silica directly stimulated collagen synthesis and decreased the amount of <SP>3</SP>H&hyphen;glucosamine&hyphen;labeled GAG. Silica&hyphen;treated fibroblasts secreted less TGF&bgr; than untreated controls, antagonized the stimulatory effect of TGF&bgr; on ECM synthesis, and reversed TGF&bgr;&hyphen;induced inhibition of cell proliferation. Northern blotting analysis showed increased interleukin&hyphen;1&agr; &lpar;IL&hyphen;1&agr;&rpar; mRNA after silica treatment. IL&hyphen;1&agr; had no influence on collagen synthesis but increased the number of WI&hyphen;1003 fibroblasts.</E></P></ABS>
<ABS><HD><E T="BIT">Conclusions&colon;</E></HD>
<P><E T="B">These results support our hypothesis that lung fibroblasts are direct silica targets. However, contradicting our hypothesis, silica antagonized TGF&bgr; activities through a TGF&bgr; downregulation and an IL&hyphen;1&agr; upregulation. The complex pattern of TGF&bgr; and IL&hyphen;1&agr; regulation in pulmonary fibroblasts is imbalanced by silica exposure and might play a key role in silica&hyphen;mediated pulmonary fibrosis.</E></P></ABS></AB>

<LV1><HD><E T="B">INTRODUCTION</E></HD>
<P>Silicosis is a form of interstitial pulmonary fibrosis caused by inhalation of free crystalline silica particles.<LK IDREF="R1-2">1</LK> Interstitial pulmonary fibroblasts are activated, and deposition of extracellular matrix &lpar;ECM&rpar; components, notably collagen and proteoglycans, is enhanced.<LK IDREF="R2-2 R3-2 R4-2 R5-2">2&ndash;5</LK> Silica particles injected into the lower respiratory tract are translocated across the epithelium into the interstitial space, where they are phagocytized by the interstitial macrophages.<LK IDREF="R6-2 R7-2">6,7</LK> Fibroblast proliferation and abnormal collagen deposition at sites of silica retention produce large interstitial nodules containing more type I than type III collagen, which is associated with alterations in collagen cross&hyphen;linking.<LK IDREF="R8-2">8</LK></P>
<P>Many growth factors and cytokines mediate the inflammatory response and fibrosis caused by exposure to mineral dusts.<LK IDREF="R9-2 R10-2">9,10</LK> Transforming growth factor&hyphen;&bgr; &lpar;TGF&bgr;&rpar;, interleukin&hyphen;1 &lpar;IL&hyphen;1&rpar; and interleukin&hyphen;6 &lpar;IL&hyphen;6&rpar; seem to play pivotal roles.<LK IDREF="R9-2 R10-2 R11-2 R12-2">9&ndash;12</LK> TGF&bgr; has a broad range of effects on cell growth and differentiation, and its isoforms have been detected in lung cells and at sites of silica retention.<LK IDREF="R13-2 R14-2 R15-2">13&ndash;15</LK> TGF&bgr; is a powerful modulator of fibroblast replication. However, fibroblast response to TGF&bgr; is complex because, depending on the presence of other growth factors or cytokines, it may induce or inhibit cell growth.<LK IDREF="R16-2">16</LK> TGF&bgr; induces collagen synthesis and sometimes affects ECM turnover by enhancing protease activity.<LK IDREF="R17-2 R18-2">17,18</LK> IL&hyphen;1 and IL&hyphen;6 are pro&hyphen;inflammatory cytokines, which are also involved in connective cell metabolism.<LK IDREF="R19-2 R20-2">19,20</LK> Exposure of blood monocytes to silica induces IL&hyphen;1 synthesis,<LK IDREF="R21-2">21</LK> and IL&hyphen;6 mediates or amplifies some of the IL&hyphen;1 tissue effects.<LK IDREF="R22-2">22</LK></P>
<P>Experimental models to date have identified interstitial macrophages as key cells in the inflammatory process induced by inhalation of silica particles. In fact, silica particles interact with macrophages and induce their activation and the release of growth factors, which, in turn, stimulate or inhibit fibroblast and epithelium proliferation and regulate connective tissue production.<LK IDREF="R23-2 R24-2 R25-2 R26-2">23&ndash;26</LK> However, in the course of silicosis, silica and pulmonary fibroblasts may come into direct contact in the interstitial space. In this study, we determined whether silica particles directly activate human pulmonary fibroblasts and affect their ECM synthesis by studying a human lung fibroblast cell line &lpar;WI&hyphen;1003&rpar; exposed to silica. We investigated cell morphology, cellular growth, ECM production and composition, and cytokine synthesis.</P></LV1>
<LV1><HD><E T="B">MATERIALS AND METHODS</E></HD>
<LV2><HD>Culture of Human Lung Fibroblasts &lpar;WI&hyphen;1003&rpar;</HD>
<P>A normal human lung fibroblast cell line, WI&hyphen;1003, was purchased from American Type Culture Collection &lpar;ATCC&rpar; and used before the 15<SP>th</SP> population doubling in all experiments. Cells were maintained in MEM &lpar;Gibco, Grand Island, NY&rpar; with 10&percnt; fetal calf serum &lpar;FCS&rpar; to achieve subconfluence. For all experiments, WI&hyphen;1003 cells were seeded for 24 hours in MEM&plus;0.5&percnt; FCS to keep them quiescent at the start of the assay<LK IDREF="R6-2">6</LK> and treated according to the following experimental schemes.</P></LV2>
<LV2><HD>Immunofluorescence Procedure</HD>
<P>The WI&hyphen;1003 cell fibroblast phenotype of WI&hyphen;1003 cells was determined as reported elsewhere by immunofluorescence using anti&hyphen;vimentin antibody.<LK IDREF="R27-2">27</LK> Cells were maintained in MEM&plus;0.5&percnt; FCS for 24 hours, washed with phosphate buffered saline &lpar;PBS&rpar; and immediately fixed in 2.5&percnt; paraformaldehyde in PBS buffer for 10 minutes at room temperature. After brief washes, cells were permeabilized with PBS supplemented with 0.1&percnt; Triton X&hyphen;100 for 5 minutes and washed in PBS buffer. Coverslips were incubated for 1 hour with bovine serum albumin in PBS buffer before overlaying for 1 hour with mouse monoclonal anti&hyphen;vimentin &lpar;1&colon;40&rpar; &lpar;Sigma Chemical Co, St Louis, Mo&rpar;. After incubation for 1hour, cells were washed three times and overlaid for 1 hour with anti&hyphen;mouse immunoglobulin G &lpar;IgG&rpar; TRITC conjugate &lpar;1&colon;50&rpar;, antibody developed in goat &lpar;Sigma&rpar;. The coverslips were mounted in 90&percnt; glycerol in PBS and examined under a Zeiss Dialux 20 EB epifluorescence microscope &lpar;Zeiss, Rueil Malmaison, France&rpar;, equipped with automatic microphotography. Pictures were taken with Fujichrome HP 1600 film &lpar;Fuji Photo Film USA, Inc, Elmsford, NY&rpar; and developed by the Cibachrome method.</P></LV2>
<LV2><HD>Electron Microscopic Procedure</HD>
<P>WI&hyphen;1003 lung fibroblasts were treated with crystalline silica for 24 hours in MEM&plus;0.5&percnt; FCS at a concentration of 50 &mgr;g&sol;mL or left untreated &lpar;controls&rpar;. Silica &lpar;SiO<SB>2</SB>, obtained from Sigma Chemical Co, 99&percnt; microcrystalline silica containing particles between 1 and 5 &mgr;m&rpar; was heated for 2 hours at 200&deg;F to inactivate any endotoxin. After prolonged washes, cells were dissociated in 0.25&percnt; phosphate&hyphen;buffered trypsin &lpar;pH 7.2&rpar; and collected by centrifugation. Pellets were fixed in glutaraldehyde &lpar;1.7&percnt; in 0.1 M phosphate buffer, pH 7.2&rpar; for 30 minutes, washed in PBS, and postfixed in osmium tetroxide &lpar;1&percnt; in 0.1M phosphate buffer&rpar; for 30 minutes. They were dehydrated through a graded ethanol series and embedded in araldite resin &lpar;Durcapan&hyphen;Fluka AG, Buchs SG, Switzerland&rpar;. Thin sections were obtained on a Reichert ultramicrotome, transferred to a copper grid, stained with uranyl acetate and lead citrate, and examined through a Hitachi 800 electron microscope &lpar;Hitachi, Ltd, Tokyo, Japan&rpar;. For scanning electron microscopy examination, cells were fixed in 1&percnt; glutaraldehyde in PBS for 15 minutes at room temperature, washed three times in PBS, and dehydrated stepwise in ethanol. After critical point drying by the Freon method, samples were coated with gold&hyphen;palladium &lpar;60&colon;40&rpar; by vacuum evaporation on a moving stage and viewed under a 501 Philips scanning electron microscope &lpar;FEI Co, Hillsboro, Ore&rpar;. The acceleration voltage was 15 kV.</P></LV2>
<LV2><HD>Cell Proliferation</HD>
<P>&lsqb;<SP>3</SP>H&rsqb;&hyphen;thymidine incorporation was used to measure DNA synthesis. WI&hyphen;1003 lung fibroblasts were treated for 24 hours in MEM&plus;0.5&percnt; FCS with either silica &lpar;50 &mgr;g&sol;mL&rpar; or TGF&bgr; &lpar;Sigma Chemical Co&rpar; at the dose of 4 ng&sol;mL used as internal control.<LK IDREF="R28-2">28</LK> Untreated fibroblasts &lpar;controls&rpar; were seeded for 24 hours in MEM&plus;0.5&percnt; FCS alone. All the cultures were rinsed and incubated in serum&hyphen;free medium for additional 24 hours. To asses the effects of TGF&bgr; after mineral dust exposure, silica&hyphen;treated WI&hyphen;1003 underwent prolonged rinsing followed by incubation in serum&hyphen;free medium with TGF&bgr; &lpar;4 ng&sol;mL&rpar; for another 24 hours. Parallel cultures exposed to silica at doses of 25, 100, and 250 &mgr;g&sol;mL did not show any dose&hyphen;dependent effects. 1 &mgr;Ci&sol;mL of &lsqb;<SP>3</SP>H&rsqb;&hyphen;thymidine &lpar;specific activity &lsqb;sa&rsqb;, 81.0 Ci&sol;mmol&semi; Amersham Pharmacia Biotech, Piscataway, NJ&rpar; was added to all cultures for the final 24 hours. At the end of in vitro maintenance, cells were solubilized in 0.5 M NaOH and an aliquot precipitated with 10&percnt; TCA &lpar;30 minutes at 4&deg; C&rpar; on glass fiber filters &lpar;0.45 &mgr;m&semi; Millipore, Bedford, Mass&rpar;. After washing with cold 5&percnt; TCA, the filters were dried and counted in 10 mL of scintillation fluid &lpar;Ultima Gold, Packard Chemical, Groningen, The Netherlands&rpar; in an LKB scintillation counter. Incorporation of the radioactive label into the TCA insoluble fraction was calculated as cpm&sol;well. To determine cell number and DNA amount, at the end of incubation, WI&hyphen;1003 fibroblasts were scraped with a rubber policeman, pelleted by centrifugation at low speed, and resuspended in a small volume &lpar;0.1&hyphen;0.5 mL&rpar; of medium. Trypan blue was added to the cell suspension to obtain a final concentration of 2 mg&sol;mL. Cells were incubated for 5 minutes at room temperature, and the number of stained cells counted in a hemacytometer. DNA content was determined by a fluorometric assay.<LK IDREF="R29-2">29</LK> Results of the assay are expressed as &mgr;g&sol;well.</P></LV2>
<LV2><HD>Collagen Synthesis</HD>
<P>WI&hyphen;1003 lung fibroblasts were treated for 24 hours with silica &lpar;50 &mgr;g&sol;mL&rpar; or TGF&bgr; &lpar;4 ng&sol;mL&rpar; using the same experimental scheme performed for &lsqb;<SP>3</SP>H&rsqb;&hyphen;thymidine incorporation studies &lpar;see above&rpar;. All cultures were maintained with 50 &mgr;g&sol;mL of ascorbic acid and 50 &mgr;g&sol;mL of &bgr;&hyphen;aminopropionitrile fumarate. Two microcuries per milliliter of &lsqb;<SP>3</SP>H&rsqb;&hyphen;labeled proline &lpar;sa 44 Ci&sol;mmol&semi; Amersham Pharmacia Biotech, Piscataway, NJ&rpar; were added in the last 24 hours of culture. To see whether the effects of silica on collagen synthesis are mediated by release of other fibroblast growth factors such as basic FGF &lpar;bFGF&rpar; and IL&hyphen;1, WI&hyphen;1003 cells were treated for 24 hours with bFGF &lpar;Sigma Chemical Co&rpar; or IL&hyphen;1&agr;, &lpar;recombinant human, Boehringer, Mannheim, Germany&rpar; at doses of 20 ng&sol;mL and 5 U&sol;mL, respectively. Collagen was extracted as described elsewhere.<LK IDREF="R30-2">30</LK> Briefly, cell and media were recovered separately and treated with 100 &mgr;L of cold acetic acid &lpar;0.5 M&rpar;&semi; 250 &mgr;L NaCl 25&percnt; in 0.5 M acetic acid was added and collagen obtained by centrifugation at 4000<E T="I">g</E> for 20 minutes using 200 mg&sol;mL rat skin collagen as carrier. Precipitates were dissolved in 250 &mgr;L 0.5 M acetic acid and transferred to vial inserts containing 2 mL of scintillation fluid. Results are expressed as cpm&sol;10<SP>6</SP> cells. The specificity of the assay was verified by monitoring the susceptibility of precipitates to purified bacterial collagenase &lpar;Calbiochem&hyphen;Novabiochem, CN Biosciences, San Diego, Calif&rpar;.</P></LV2>
<LV2><HD>Assessment of Glycosaminoglycans &lpar;GAG&rpar; Biosynthesis and Characterization of GAG</HD>
<P>WI&hyphen;1003 human lung fibroblasts were treated with silica or TGF&bgr; according to the same scheme used for <SP>3</SP>H thymidine incorporation studies &lpar;see above&rpar;. Five microcuries per milliliter of &lsqb;<SP>3</SP>H&rsqb;&hyphen;glucosamine hydrochloride &lpar;NEN, Du Pont, de Nemours, Germany&semi; sa 29 Ci&sol;mmol&rpar; were added in the last 24 hours of fibroblast cultures.

<LV1><HD><E T="B">DISCUSSION</E></HD>
<P>The current hypothesis on the pathogenesis of silicosis states that, after silica internalization, interstitial macrophages release cytokines that initiate fibrosis.<LK IDREF="R23-2 R24-2 R25-2 R26-2">23&ndash;26</LK> For the first time, we present electron microscopy evidence of WI&hyphen;1003 lung fibroblast uptake of silica particles. We opted for a cell line rather than primary fibroblasts because it has been demonstrated that primary fibroblasts are a heterogeneous population of cells that differ in functional properties such as proliferation rates and collagen synthesis.<LK IDREF="R35-2">35</LK> The phagocytic ability of human adult and embryonic fibroblasts has been observed in their internalization of parasites.<LK IDREF="R36-2 R37-2">36,37</LK> Other reports showed that dermal fibroblasts attached silica particles to the cell surface without internalizing them.<LK IDREF="R38-2">38</LK></P>
<P>In addition, the present study determined whether silica has a direct modulatory effect on pulmonary fibroblast ECM production, whether it acts alone, and whether its action is mediated by fibrogenic cytokines. Our data suggest pulmonary fibroblasts are directly activated after silica internalization. We provide evidence that silica modulates ECM production in WI&hyphen;1003 lung fibroblasts by stimulating collagen production and reducing GAG secretion. The effects of silica on ECM production could have a pathological impact considering that an imbalance in GAG synthesis and degradation has been observed in interstitial pulmonary diseases such as bleomycin&hyphen;induced pulmonary fibrosis,<LK IDREF="R39-2">39</LK> sarcoidosis,<LK IDREF="R40-2">40</LK> cystic fibrosis,<LK IDREF="R41-2">41</LK> and alveolar proteinosis.<LK IDREF="R42-2">42</LK></P>
<P>In the same in vitro system we studied the fibrogenic effects of TGF&bgr;. As this cytokine is known to stimulate ECM, we chose it as a positive internal control. We observed that TGF&bgr; greatly stimulated collagen production and sulphated GAG secretion. On the other hand, bFGF, a cytokine affecting fibroblast activity, did not have any fibrogenic effect as it decreased collagen synthesis.</P>
<P>Our data showed that silica partially antagonized TGF&bgr; activity on collagen and sulfated GAG synthesis. The antagonistic interactions between silica and TGF&bgr; may be related to the pathogenesis of silicosis. Indeed, changes in collagen content and in the relative distribution of the different GAG moieties are closely related to fibrosis development.<LK IDREF="R43-2">43</LK> Interstitial GAG thus affect the stability of collagen fibrils<LK IDREF="R8-2">8</LK> and the position of newly synthesized elastin,<LK IDREF="R44-2">44</LK> consequently influencing lung compliance.<LK IDREF="R45-2 R46-2">45,46</LK> Alterations in GAG classes, and in CS content in particular, induce changes in membrane proteins, which mediate cell adhesion and which function as cell surface receptors for HA,<LK IDREF="R47-2">47</LK> fibronectin,<LK IDREF="R48-2">48</LK> and type I collagen.<LK IDREF="R49-2">49</LK> Furthermore, GAG chains capture the growth factors at cell surface and in the matrix, thus concentrating growth factor activities and enhancing their availability to cell receptors. Because the binding strength between GAGs and growth factors is determined by the degree of GAG sulfation, any variation in individual GAG class expression might alter the biological activity of cytokines and growth factors.</P>
<P>Our experiments also showed silica did not stimulate WI&hyphen;1003 cell proliferation and was able to reverse the TGF&bgr;&hyphen;induced growth inhibition. Although TGF&bgr; inhibition on lung fibroblast proliferation has been observed in another human lung fibroblast cell line, HFL1&hyphen;CCL&hyphen;53,<LK IDREF="R50-2">50</LK> a competitive effect of silica has never been described. To verify whether the silica&hyphen;induced fibrogenic effects could be mediated by silica&hyphen;induced TGF&bgr; overproduction, we performed TGF&bgr; bioassays on CM obtained from WI1003 treated with silica alone, TGF&bgr; alone, and silica&plus;TGF&bgr;.</P>
<P>WI&hyphen;1003 cells spontaneously released active TGF&bgr;, prevalently the &bgr;<SB>1</SB> isoform. TGF&bgr;&hyphen;CM and control&hyphen;CM had similar TGF&bgr; bioactivity, probably because TGF&bgr;&hyphen;CM contains binding proteins that partially reduce TGF&bgr; activity. However, the amount of TGF&bgr; was greater when WI&hyphen;1003 were TGF&bgr;&hyphen;treated, suggesting a positive amplification loop in an autocrine fashion and confirming reports on other systems.<LK IDREF="R51-2">51</LK> When we isolated total RNA, we detected the TGF&bgr; transcript but silica did not affect it. Silica treatment alone or in combination with TGF&bgr; reduced WI&hyphen;1003 active TGF&bgr; secretion, suggesting that silica acts at a posttranslational level and explaining, in part, silica inhibition of TGF&bgr; activities. The finding also suggests that silica&hyphen;induced collagen stimulation is not a result of a TGF&bgr; autocrine action. The hypothesis that silica partially reverses TGF&bgr; effects by forming a chemical complex with TGF&bgr; is not supported by a parallel TGF&bgr; bioassay performed with silica and TGF&bgr; standard instead of CM. The experiment provides evidence that TGF&bgr; bioactivity is not reduced with combined silica and TGF&bgr; standards.</P>
<P>Finally, we observed that silica treatment upregulated IL&hyphen;1&agr; mRNA without significantly changing the IL&hyphen;6 transcript. Increased IL&hyphen;1&agr; mRNA expression has been observed in asbestos&hyphen;<LK IDREF="R21-2">21</LK> and silica&hyphen;treated macrophages.<LK IDREF="R52-2">52</LK> In our experimental model, IL&hyphen;1&agr; did not stimulate collagen synthesis but did increase WI&hyphen;1003 cell number, suggesting that the antagonistic effects of silica on TGF&bgr; activities may be mediated by a concomitant TGF&bgr; downregulation and IL&hyphen;1&agr; upregulation. Stimulation of pulmonary fibroblast growth is necessary to replace damaged connective tissue, but inhibition of fibroblast replication is equally necessary to reduce an uncontrolled accumulation of ECM&hyphen;producing cells. In conclusion, these data suggest that there is a complex pattern of TGF&bgr; and IL&hyphen;1&agr; regulation and expression in the lung and indicate that, like many other cell types, lung fibroblasts should be considered as effector cells mediating silica&hyphen;induced damage in lung fibrosis. Because cellular processes are controlled by the cytokine cascades and networks rather than by individual cytokines, an imbalance in several cytokine secretions produced by lung fibroblasts after silica uptake might play a key role in the development of silicosis.</P></LV1>

<LV1><HD><E T="B">INTRODUCTION</E></HD>
<P>A variety of immune system abnormalities characterize systemic lupus erythematosus &lpar;SLE&rpar;. Their hallmark, present in both SLE patients and in lupus&hyphen;prone mice is B&hyphen;cell overactivity.<LK IDREF="R1-3 R2-3 R3-3 R4-3">1&ndash;4</LK> Autoreactive lupus B cells produce a spectrum of autoantibodies &lpar;autoAb&rpar;, some of which are currently thought to contribute to tissue damage, as is the case for cationic nephritogenic anti&hyphen;dsDNA autoAb.<LK IDREF="R5-3">5</LK> Lupus patients commonly have a polyclonal hypergammaglobulinemia that is composed in part of natural, nonpathogenic Ab and autoAb. Exogenous factors such as defective suppressor T&hyphen;cell function, increased helper T&hyphen;cell function, and&sol;or overreactivity to cytokines delivered to lupus B cells in a paracrine and&sol;or endocrine manner are identified mechanisms that may partly contribute to lupus B&hyphen;cell overactivity. However, whether B cells in SLE are intrinsically intact is a matter of debate.</P>
<P>We have recently reported that a crucial B&hyphen;cell function, the signaling biochemical cascade initiated by the B&hyphen;cell surface antigen receptor &lpar;BCR&rpar; is abnormal in fresh peripheral B cells from patients with SLE. After B&hyphen;cell stimulation via their immunoglobulin M &lpar;IgM&rpar; or IgD BCR, B cells from patients with SLE display increased Ca<SP>2&plus;</SP> fluxes and an enhanced production of tyrosyl&hyphen;phosphorylated cellular proteins. Because these early signal&hyphen;transduction abnormalities are disease&hyphen;specific and independent of disease activity or treatment, they may reflect an intrinsic lupus B&hyphen;cell defect.<LK IDREF="R6-3">6</LK></P>
<P>BCR&hyphen;initiated signaling biochemistry is a well&hyphen;regulated cascade of intracellular events.<LK IDREF="R7-3 R8-3">7,8</LK> Cell membrane molecules such as CD21 enhance BCR&hyphen;mediated signaling, and molecules such as Fc&ggr;RIIB1, CD5, and CD22 inhibit the antigen receptor&hyphen;initiated B&hyphen;cell activation.<LK IDREF="R9-3">9</LK> Elegant experimental work has shown that CD22 undergoes tyrosyl&hyphen;phosphorylation after BCR&hyphen;mediated stimulation and that for phosphorylation to occur, intact function of the <E T="I">src</E>&hyphen;family kinase Lyn is mandatory.<LK IDREF="R10-3 R11-3">10,11</LK> The tyrosyl&hyphen;phosphorylated CD22 molecule becomes a docking site for the protein tyrosine phosphatase SHP&hyphen;1 &lpar;previously named HCP or PTP1C&rpar; that terminates phosphorylation cascades initiated by the BCR.<LK IDREF="R12-3 R13-3">12,13</LK> It is interesting that Lyn was initially thought to be solely an enzyme involved in B&hyphen;cell activation.<LK IDREF="R14-3 R15-3">14,15</LK> However, Lyn is now also considered to be an integral part of signaling inhibition. Recent experimental models revealed that Lyn function may be redundant for BCR&hyphen;mediated activation and that Lyn also mediates BCR&hyphen;initiated signaling inhibition.<LK IDREF="R16-3 R17-3">16,17</LK> In fact, phenotypes of Lyn&hyphen;knockout and CD22&hyphen;knockout murine models are quite similar, both displaying enhanced BCR&hyphen;triggered early signaling events and autoimmunity as manifested by the production of multiple Ab.<LK IDREF="R18-3 R19-3 R20-3 R21-3 R22-3 R23-3 R24-3 R25-3">18&ndash;25</LK></P>
<P>Expression of Lyn and CD22 has not been addressed previously in B cells from patients with SLE. Herein, in our effort to understand better the molecular basis of lupus B&hyphen;cell hyperactivity, we present studies showing that Lyn but not CD22 expression is deficient in lupus B cells. Although in the cell lysates obtained from lupus patients Lyn protein is not totally missing, our experiments demonstrate a quantitative defect at the Lyn mRNA level. Only patients with SLE display Lyn deficiency, indicating that this defect may explain, at least in part, the characteristic signaling overactivity of B cells from patients with SLE at the molecular level.</P></LV1>
<LV1><HD><E T="B">PATIENTS AND METHODS</E></HD>
<LV2><HD>Patients and Control Individuals</HD>
<P>Twenty&hyphen;one patients with SLE fulfilling at least four of the 11 American College of Rheumatology classification criteria for lupus &lpar;all Caucasian women&semi; mean age, 39 years&semi; range, 25&hyphen;56 years&rpar; were studied.<LK IDREF="R26-3">26</LK> Seventeen patients were receiving prednisone &lpar;5&hyphen;20 mg&sol;d&rpar;, five were on hydroxychloroquine, two were on low&hyphen;dose oral methotrexate treatment &lpar;7.5&hyphen;10.0 mg&sol;wk&rpar;, and three did not receive any medications. Patients receiving prednisone were studied at least 24 hours after their last dose.

<LV2><HD>Cells and Ab</HD>
<P>Heparinized peripheral venous blood &lpar;60&hyphen;80 mL&rpar; was drawn from all study subjects. Peripheral blood mononuclear cells &lpar;PBMC&rpar; were obtained by standard Ficoll&hyphen;Hypaque gradient centrifugation. This cell population was enriched in B cells by rosetting with sheep red blood cells &lpar;generously supplied by Dr Nomikou and Dr Maggana, Department of Virology, Ministry for Agriculture, Ag.

In the latter case, the reaction was terminated by adding an equal volume of ice&hyphen;cold stop buffer &lpar;10 mM Tris, 50 mM NaCl, 5 mM EDTA&rpar; containing various protease inhibitors, and cells were pelleted by a brief centrifugation at 11,000<E T="I">g</E> at 4&deg;C. The lysis buffer used was 1&percnt; Triton X&hyphen;100 in the stop buffer described above. After cell lysis and a second centrifugation at 14,000<E T="I">g</E> at 4&deg;C for 15 minutes, whole&hyphen;cell lysates were separated from nuclei and other insoluble material. The protein content of cell lysates was measured using the Bio&hyphen;Rad protein assay &lpar;Bio&hyphen;Rad, Hercules, Calif&rpar; according to the manufacturer's instructions.</P>
<P>Ten micrograms of total protein per sample were analyzed electrophoretically in 10&percnt; polyacrylamide&sol;SDS gels &lpar;Bio&hyphen;Rad&rpar;. Resolved proteins from the gels were transferred onto nitrocellulose membranes &lpar;Trans Blot Transfer Medium, Bio&hyphen;Rad&rpar; using a semidry transfer system &lpar;Nova Blot, Pharmacia Biotech, Sweden&rpar;. Membranes were blocked for 3 hours in PBS, 5&percnt; fat&hyphen;free dried milk, and 0.25&percnt; Tween and subsequently incubated with the appropriate Ab at 4&deg;C overnight. Antihuman Lyn or antihuman Syk &lpar;both were rabbit polyclonal IgG, purchased from Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Santa Cruz, Calif&rpar; were used as primary Ab in a 1&colon;1000 dilution in blocking buffer.

<LV2><HD>RNA Extraction and Reverse Transcription</HD>
<P>PBMC were isolated from whole venous blood as above. RNA was subsequently extracted using RNAzol B &lpar;Tel&hyphen;Test, Inc, Friendswood, Tex&rpar;. For reverse transcription, 1 &mgr;g of total RNA was reverse&hyphen;transcribed in a total volume of 20 &mgr;L. First, RNA was heated at 70&deg;C for 3&hyphen;4 minutes and then immediately cooled in ice. One microliter of random hexamer primers &lpar;5 nM&rpar; was added first, followed by 200 nM of each dNTP, 24 U of RNAseOUT &lpar;Rnase inhibitor&rpar; and 4 &mgr;L of RT buffer. Two microliters of DTT &lpar;0.01M&rpar; and 200 U of M&hyphen;MLV Reverse Transcriptase &lpar;Gibco BRL, Grand Island, NY&rpar; were added last, and the reaction was performed in 42&deg;C for 1 hour, after heating at 95&deg;C for 5 minutes. The cDNA samples were immediately stored in &hyphen;70&deg;C. Successful reverse transcription was evaluated using 1 &mgr;l of cDNA for polymerase chain reaction &lpar;PCR&rpar; with &bgr;&hyphen;actin primers at 94&deg;C for 1 minute, then 56&deg;C for 1 minute, and, finally, at 72&deg;C for 1 minute, for 23 cycles.</P></LV2>
<LV2><HD>Semiquantitative PCR for Lyn</HD>
<P>Two pairs of primers specific for human Lyn gene and &bgr;&hyphen;actin were designed and synthesized according to their sequences.<LK IDREF="R28-3 R29-3">28,29</LK> The primers for human Lyn gene were as follows&colon; 5&prime;&hyphen;GGAGGAGCCCATTTACATCATCA&hyphen; 3&prime; and 5 &prime;&hyphen;AGTTCTCCACACGGGGCATCC&hyphen;3&prime;.

Twenty&hyphen;one, 23, 25, and 28 PCR cycles were initially run for both genes to identify the optimal PCR cycles for semiquantitation. Twenty&hyphen;five PCR cycles &lpar;optimal for Lyn&rpar; were run with Lyn primers &lpar;20 pM each&rpar; in a total volume of 25 &mgr;L, with 2.5 &mgr;L of buffer &lpar;10x&rpar;, 1.5 &mgr;L of MgCl<SB>2</SB> &lpar;25 nM&rpar;, and 2.5 U of Taq DNA polymerase &lpar;Promega, Madison, Wis&rpar; at 94&deg;C for 1 minute, then at 66&deg;C for 1 minute, and finally at 72&deg;C for 3 minutes. For &bgr;&hyphen;actin primers, 23 PCR cycles were optimal and were used to run PCR as above, at 94&deg;C for 1minute, then 56&deg;C for 1 minute, and finally at 72&deg;C for 1 minute. Different amounts of cDNA &lpar;0.5, 1.0, 2.0, and 3.0 &mgr;L&rpar; were run for the optimal cycles as described.

<P>Circulating, negatively selected B&hyphen;cell&hyphen;enriched PBMC from all study subjects &lpar;lupus patients, individuals with other systemic rheumatic diseases or B&hyphen;cell dyscrasias, and healthy donors&rpar; were evaluated for cell&hyphen;surface CD22 expression using two&hyphen;color flow cytometry. Anti&hyphen;CD20&hyphen;FITC mAb or anti&hyphen;CD19&hyphen;FITC mAb were used as standard B&hyphen;cell markers.

<LV2><HD>Diminished Expression of Lyn Kinase in Circulating, Resting B&hyphen;Cell&hyphen;Enriched PBMC From Patients With SLE</HD>
<P>Normal amounts of CD22 on the surface of lupus B cells do not exclude abnormal CD22&hyphen;initiated signaling. It has been reported recently that, in the absence of Lyn, B cells cannot transduce CD22&hyphen;initiated signaling inhibition despite the presence of adequate amounts of CD22.<LK IDREF="R11-3">11</LK> Therefore, in an effort to further dissect the CD22&hyphen;initiated signaling inhibition machinery, we investigated for possible aberrations in the expression of the downstream mediator kinase Lyn, although checking for abnormalities in the expression of Lyn protein does not equate to checking CD22&hyphen;initiated signaling. Whole B&hyphen;cell&hyphen;enriched PBMC lysates obtained from 12 patients with SLE &lpar;of 18 who consented to donating 80 mL of whole blood&rpar;, 10 disease&hyphen;control subjects &lpar;five with RA, two with systemic sclerosis, one with juvenile RA, one with reactive arthritis, and one with primary antiphospholipid syndrome&rpar;, and five healthy donors were analyzed. Lyn was always present in similar amounts in the lysates obtained from disease&hyphen;control group patients, as well as in the lysates from the healthy donors. However, we observed that in eight &lpar;66.6&percnt;&rpar; of 12 lupus patients studied, expression of Lyn kinase was decreased, whereas in five of those patients it was barely detectable during optimal film exposure times &lpar;<LK IDREF="F2-3">Figure 2</LK>&rpar;. Nevertheless, exposure of the detecting films for a prolonged time &lpar;&gt;30 minutes&rpar; that was well beyond film sensitivity revealed that the band for Lyn was present although heavily diminished &lpar;not shown&rpar;. The densitometric reduction of Lyn in eight lupus patients ranged from 1.5&hyphen; to 5&hyphen;fold, compared with the mean densitometric value of the control group, whereas in the remaining lupus patients &lpar;n&equals;4&rpar;, it was similar to the control group. Overall, densitometric analysis revealed that Lyn band intensity was significantly less in the lysates obtained from lupus patients &lpar;n&equals;12&rpar; compared with the control group &lpar;n&equals;15&semi; mean Lyn intensity&plusmn;SD, 1807&plusmn;1224 vs 2991&plusmn;829, <E T="I">P</E>&equals;0.007&rpar;.</P>

<LV1><HD><E T="B">DISCUSSION</E></HD>
<P>Our investigation was based on the paradigms that evolved from the study of the CD22&hyphen; and Lyn&hyphen;knockout animals or Lyn&hyphen;deficient cells&semi; these display enhanced BCR&hyphen;initiated early signaling events, circulating autoAb, and systemic autoimmunity. We searched for possible defects of B&hyphen;cell surface CD22 expression and intracellular Lyn content of circulating B cells from patients with SLE. Expression of these molecules had not been studied previously in human lupus.</P>
<P>First, we looked into B&hyphen;cell surface expression of the CD22 marker using flow cytometry. We found no differences between patients with SLE, patients with other diseases &lpar;systemic autoimmune rheumatic diseases, in the majority&rpar;, and healthy volunteers. There was also no difference in CD22 expression between patients with active and those with inactive disease. Nevertheless, when expression of another B&hyphen;cell surface molecule, CD21, was studied in parallel as a positive control marker, we found that there was an obvious stratification of patients with active SLE &lpar;decreased B&hyphen;cell surface CD21 expression&rpar; and those with inactive disease &lpar;normal B&hyphen;cell surface CD21 expression&rpar;. Our CD21 B&hyphen;cell&hyphen;surface expression data are in agreement with those of previously published results.<LK IDREF="R30-3 R31-3">30,31</LK> From the above, we conclude that CD22 expression on the surface of peripheral, circulating, negatively selected B cells from patients with SLE is intact and cannot explain the enhanced BCR&hyphen;initiated early signal transduction events previously reported for lupus B cells. Normal CD22 expression does not exclude abnormalities in the CD22&hyphen;initiated signaling biochemistry.</P>
<P>Second, we explored the expression of the <E T="I">src</E>&hyphen;family protein tyrosine kinase Lyn for possible aberrations. Although addressing the levels of Lyn protein does not equate addressing CD22&hyphen;mediated signaling, it was recently clearly demonstrated that Lyn is the principal mediator of CD22&hyphen;initiated signaling inhibition. The molecular basis for CD22&hyphen;mediated signaling inhibition lies in the reversible tyrosyl phosphorylation of the immunoreceptor tyrosine&hyphen;based inhibitory motif &lpar;ITIM&rpar; that the CD22 cytoplasmic tail bears. Once the ITIM of CD22 becomes tyrosyl phosphorylated, it recruits the protein tyrosine phosphatase SHP&hyphen;1 that dephosphorylates and thus deactivates various cellular enzymic systems that were activated previously. <LK IDREF="R12-3">12</LK> The mediator for this critical CD22 ITIM tyrosyl phosphorylation is currently known to be kinase Lyn.<LK IDREF="R11-3">11</LK> In the absence of Lyn, the CD22 inhibitory pathway is not functional despite adequate amounts of surface CD22 expression.</P>
<P>Until recently, Lyn was thought of only as an integral part of the BCR&hyphen;mediated B&hyphen;cell activating machinery.<LK IDREF="R14-3">14</LK> Knockout experiments demonstrated that the role of Lyn in stimulation may be redundant&semi; BCR&hyphen;initiated early signal transduction events are propagated in the absence of Lyn, and in fact, they are enhanced.<LK IDREF="R16-3 R17-3">16,17</LK> It was also shown that immature B cells develop properly, but mature B cells are decreased in the absence of Lyn.<LK IDREF="R18-3">18</LK></P>
<P>Our experiments clearly demonstrate that in 66&percnt; of the lupus patients studied the content of Lyn found in resting, fresh, circulating B&hyphen;cell&hyphen;enriched PBMC lysates was decreased compared with that of normal&hyphen; or disease&hyphen;control individuals. Lyn was not found to be totally missing in any of the studied lupus patients, but in some it was severely decreased. In contrast, Lyn protein was always adequately expressed in all healthy&hyphen; and disease&hyphen;control individuals studied, implying that Lyn deficiency is lupus&hyphen;specific. Similar to Lyn, Syk kinase is abundantly expressed in B cells and mediates BCR&hyphen;initiated signaling.<LK IDREF="R32-3 R33-3 R34-3">32&ndash;34</LK> Using Syk as an internal control revealed that Lyn but not Syk kinase expression is specifically decreased. We used a polyclonal anti&hyphen;Lyn Ab to minimize the possibility of detecting a linear or conformational epitope of Lyn only. Nevertheless, a large number of proteins are found in the low&hyphen;50 molecular size area&semi; therefore, we propose that the use of anti&hyphen;Lyn immunoprecipitations would greatly enhance the value of our initial Western immunoblot evaluation of Lyn deficiency, providing more conclusive results.</P>
<P>In our effort to determine whether B&hyphen;cell stimulation alters Lyn content, we also studied anti&hyphen;IgM stimulated B&hyphen;cell&hyphen;enriched PBMC lysates from patients with SLE as well as from control individuals. Lyn deficiency was detected in the lysates obtained from patients with SLE in the activated&hyphen;cell stage, and in some it could be detected more readily at this stage than at the resting&hyphen;cell stage. This suggests that Lyn deficiency is not the outcome of possible polyclonal B&hyphen;cell activation occurring in vivo in patients with SLE. We evaluated Lyn protein levels in Western immunoblots of 1&hyphen;minute anti&hyphen;IgM&hyphen;activated B cells&semi; 1&hyphen;minute activation is optimal for normal B cells. Nevertheless, it is not known if lupus B cells display the same anti&hyphen;IgM&hyphen;mediated activation kinetics, a point that needs to be addressed in future studies.</P>
<P>Furthermore, the normal &ldquo;double&hyphen;band&rdquo; appearance of Lyn &lpar;present in all control individuals&rpar; was disturbed in the resting&hyphen; as well as in the activated&hyphen;B&hyphen;cell lysates in patients with SLE. Only the lighter p53 form could be detected in most lysates obtained from lupus patients, whereas the heavier p56 form was commonly absent.</P>
<P>To investigate for the mechanisms responsible, we optimized and subsequently constructed semiquantitative PCR for Lyn and studied lupus patients with the most profound Lyn protein deficiency. In these patients, the amounts of Lyn mRNA were significantly decreased compared with those normal donors. This finding persisted over time, because re&hyphen;evaluation of Lyn mRNA during a later follow&hyphen;up visit of the same patients and healthy volunteers revealed that Lyn mRNA deficiency persisted despite changes in disease activity. Our Lyn mRNA deficiency data imply that this specific mRNA may be abnormal or unstable or selectively degraded. Similar aberrations at the transcription level have been described previously for the T&hyphen;cell receptor &zgr; chain in circulating T cells from patients with SLE.<LK IDREF="R35-3">35</LK> On the basis of the above data, we propose that Lyn deficiency in patients with SLE may reflect an intrinsic defect at the transcription level.</P>
<P>We subsequently investigated for possible correlation between Lyn deficiency, autoAb profiles, and the appearance of renal disease&semi; anti&hyphen;dsDNA autoAb were detected in five &lpar;62&percnt;&rpar; of eight Lyn&hyphen;deficient lupus patients but in only one &lpar;25&percnt;&rpar; of the four Lyn&hyphen;sufficient patients with SLE examined. Renal disease, manifested as active urinary sediment and&sol;or as proteinuria, was present in three of the eight Lyn&hyphen;deficient patients but in none of the four lupus patients with normal Lyn content. The above data underscore that SLE, a heterogeneous disease with polygenic contribution, and the interesting monogenic Lyn&hyphen;knockout murine lupus model have important pathogenic differences. The expression and&sol;or function of other signaling regulatory molecules may be aberrant in SLE. The concept of a regulatory CD19&sol;CD22&sol;Lyn&sol;SHP&hyphen;1 loop that modulates antigen receptor signaling is currently evolving.<LK IDREF="R36-3 R37-3">36,37</LK> On the basis of this concept, we recently reported that B&hyphen;cell CD19, a molecule that both influences and is influenced by the CD22&sol;Lyn&sol;SHP&hyphen;1 pathway, is decreased in patients with SLE.<LK IDREF="R38-3">38</LK></P>
<P>To conclude, we find that the expression of Lyn kinase, an integral part of the CD22&hyphen;initiated signaling&hyphen;inhibition machinery, but not the expression of CD22 itself is deficient in B cells of patients with SLE. Because this abnormality was disease&hyphen;specific and because it may explain, at least in part, the aberrant BCR&hyphen;mediated signaling that characterizes lupus B cells, we propose that it may represent a lupus B&hyphen;cell defect of potential pathogenetic significance.</P></LV1></BD>

<LV1><HD><E T="B">INTRODUCTION</E></HD>
<P>Lung transplantation clearly improves survival of appropriately selected patients with end&hyphen;stage lung diseases. Current indications for lung transplantation include emphysema, idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis, primary pulmonary hypertension, and cystic fibrosis, among others. Postoperative graft survival is limited in more than half of the cases by development of obliterative bronchiolitis &lpar;OB&rpar;.<LK IDREF="R1-4">1</LK> Acute rejection, which precedes OB, is identified histologically by lymphocytic inflammation around small vessels and airways.<LK IDREF="R2-4">2</LK> The mechanism of airway inflammation in lung allografts is not fully understood. Proposed mechanisms include acute rejection, host response to infection, and tissue HLA mismatching.</P>
<P>Nitric oxide &lpar;&middot;NO&rpar; and the product of its reaction with superoxide &lpar;O<SB>2</SB><SP>&hyphen;</SP>&rpar;, peroxynitrite anion &lpar;ONOO<SP>&hyphen;</SP>&rpar;, have been implicated in organ allograft rejection. For example, &middot;NO production as assessed by serum nitrite measurement increased during acute rejection of rat lung transplants. Aminoguanidine, an inhibitor of inducible nitric oxide synthase &lpar;iNOS&rpar;, decreased severity of rat lung allograft rejection.<LK IDREF="R3-4">3</LK> In contrast, epithelial iNOS expression decreased in a heterotopic rat tracheal allograft model of chronic OB.<LK IDREF="R4-4">4</LK> Aminoguanidine worsened experimental OB, while L&hyphen;arginine, a precursor of &middot;NO, significantly reduced tracheal lumen obliteration.</P>
<P>On the other hand, evidence that confirms nitric oxide synthase &lpar;NOS&rpar; activation in transplanted human lungs has also been published. Mason et al<LK IDREF="R5-4">5</LK> report iNOS expression and nitrotyrosine &lpar;NT&rpar; &lpar;detected by immunocytochemistry&rpar; in airway epithelium present near OB lesions. McDermott et al<LK IDREF="R6-4">6</LK> have reported increased constitutive NOS &lpar;cNOS&rpar; and NT immunoreactivity in transplant recipients with OB. Nitrotyrosine staining occurs in other clinical lung injuries and experimental models, which include acute respiratory distress syndrome,<LK IDREF="R7-4">7</LK> idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis,<LK IDREF="R8-4">8</LK> and asbestos inhalation.<LK IDREF="R9-4">9</LK></P>
<P>In a previous study of 82 patients and four normal controls, we found that transplant patients had significantly higher levels of RNS metabolites &lpar;ie, total nitrite&rpar; in both BALF and serum.<LK IDREF="R10-4">10</LK> In those 82 patients, BALF NT &lpar;measured by enzyme&hyphen;linked immunosorbent assay&rpar; correlated with histologically evident airway inflammation. Total nitrite concentrations in patients' BALF and serum also significantly exceeded controls. These data indicated RNS were present, and serum nitrite concentration clearly separated transplant patients &lpar;as a group&rpar; from controls.</P>
<P>Airway epithelial lining fluid &lpar;ELF&rpar; is adjacent to a rich source of &middot;NO, the respiratory epithelium, and contains macrophages and neutrophils that produce O<SB>2</SB><SP>&hyphen;</SP> and MPO. &middot;NO can react exceptionally rapidly &lpar;&gt;10<SP>9</SP> M<SP>&hyphen;</SP><SP>1</SP>s<SP>&hyphen;</SP><SP>1</SP>&rpar; with O<SB>2</SB><SP>&hyphen;</SP> to form ONOO<SP>&hyphen;</SP>, a strong oxidant capable of nitrating proteins.<LK IDREF="R11-4">11</LK> MPO can catalyze the formation of a nitrating and chlorinating intermediate &lpar;possibly nitryl chloride&rpar; using NO<SB>2</SB><SP>&hyphen;</SP> and hydrogen peroxide.<LK IDREF="R12-4">12</LK> Protein nitration is detected by immunohistochemical staining of NT in tissue or by finding free NT in biological fluids. Nitration of lung proteins may have functional implications. Exposure of surfactant to high concentrations of RNS in vitro decreases its ability to minimize surface tension.<LK IDREF="R13-4">13</LK> Exposure of surfactant protein A &lpar;SP&hyphen;A&rpar; to ONOO<SP>&hyphen;</SP> decreased its ability to aggregate lipids and interact with surfactant proteins SP&hyphen;B and SP&hyphen;C to lower surface tension.<LK IDREF="R14-4">14</LK> Nitration of BALF proteins likely reflects RNS production in the ELF, yet the functional importance of nitration is not firmly established.</P>
<P>On the basis of such observations, we have postulated that RNS metabolites measured in serum or BALF may reflect airway inflammation in lung transplant patients. We designed this study to examine the utility of serum and BALF RNS metabolites as noninvasive markers of airway inflammation in lung transplants. We prospectively collected clinical data, BALF samples, and serum from 40 lung transplant patients as they underwent surveillance bronchoscopy. We then assayed total nitrite and urea in serum and NO<SB>2</SB><SP>&hyphen;</SP>, NO<SB>3</SB><SP>&hyphen;</SP>, urea, protein, and MPO in BALF.</P>
<P>In this group of 40 patients, RNS metabolites in both serum and BALF correlate with airway dysfunction detected by obstruction to airflow. These data provide further support for production of RNS in transplanted lungs and suggest that serum metabolites of RNS may reflect airway inflammation.</P></LV1>

<LV2><HD>Data Analysis</HD>
<P>Data that identified patients were kept confidential. Data in the text are reported as arithmetic means&plusmn;SE, unless indicated otherwise. Mean NO<SB>2</SB><SP>&hyphen;</SP> and NO<SB>3</SB><SP>&hyphen;</SP> were compared by unpaired <E T="I">t</E> tests. Pearson product moment correlations or logistic regression analyses tested associations among prospectively chosen variables, including total nitrite, NO<SB>2</SB><SP>&hyphen;</SP> alone, NO<SB>3</SB><SP>&hyphen;</SP> alone, days after transplantation, BALF MPO, cell counts, &Dgr;FEV<SB>1</SB>, histology scores, and the presence of infection.<LK IDREF="R15-4 R16-4">15,16</LK></P></LV2>
<LV2><HD>Study Population</HD>
<P>We sampled all University of Alabama at Birmingham &lpar;UAB&rpar; lung transplant patients who underwent surveillance bronchoscopy during a 3&hyphen;month period. Informed consent was obtained from all patients. The resulting group was heterogeneous with respect to underlying lung diseases, time after transplantation, and type of transplant &lpar;single, double, or heart&hyphen;lung&rpar; because all patients were included. The study design was cross&hyphen;sectional, and no post hoc stratification was done. Protocols were approved by the UAB Institutional Review Board for human studies.</P>
<P>Clinical data obtained around the time of bronchoscopy included FEV<SB>1</SB>, postoperative change from baseline FEV<SB>1</SB> &lpar;&Dgr;FEV<SB>1</SB>&rpar;, type of transplant, days after transplantation, presence of infection &lpar;defined as positive BALF cultures or stains&rpar;, vascular &lpar;A&rpar; and airway &lpar;B&rpar; inflammation histology scores<LK IDREF="R2-4">2</LK> &lpar;obtained from clinical review of the transbronchial biopsies&rpar;, and whether treatment for rejection occurred. The control group consisted of four healthy, nonsmoking volunteers. Mean&plusmn;SD age of the volunteers was 40&plusmn;8 years &lpar;range, 33&hyphen;50 years&rpar;. BALF and serum were obtained from the controls for comparison of total nitrite, NO<SB>2</SB><SP>&hyphen;</SP>, and NO<SB>3</SB><SP>&hyphen;</SP>.</P></LV2>
<LV2><HD>Clinical Examinations</HD>
<P>Patients underwent fiberoptic bronchoscopy that used standard clinical techniques as part of a routine posttransplant protocol.<LK IDREF="R17-4">17</LK> Bronchoalveolar lavage was done during bronchoscopy. Four 25&hyphen;mL aliquots of normal saline were instilled sequentially into a subsegmental airway. Lavage fluid dwell time was minimized &lpar;&lt;1 min&sol;aliquot&rpar;. Fluid was aspirated into a syringe and kept on ice. Lavage fractions were pooled. A volume &lpar;10&hyphen;15 mL&rpar; was removed for this study and the remainder sent for clinical testing. Routine clinical testing included cultures for cytomegalovirus, bacteria, mycobacteria, and fungi, as well as cytologic, Gram's, acid fast, and fungal stains. Fluid was centrifuged at low speed &lpar;1000<E T="I">g</E>, 5 min, 4&deg;C&rpar; to remove cells and cellular debris. Supernatants were stored at &hyphen;80&deg;C until analysis. Cell pellets from lavages were stained &lpar;Diff Quik, Dade International, Deerfield, Ill&rpar; by the clinical laboratory. Slides were obtained and 200 cells were counted on each slide to obtain differential cell counts.</P>
<P>Patients also underwent transbronchial lung biopsies, which were processed routinely for pathological examination. The degree of vessel &lpar;ranked A0&hyphen;A4&rpar; and airway &lpar;ranked B0&hyphen;B4&rpar; inflammation was categorized according to a scheme proposed by the Lung Rejection Study Group.<LK IDREF="R2-4">2</LK> Pulmonary function studies were done in the pulmonary function laboratory at the UAB Kirklin Clinic. Standard clinical techniques were used. FEV<SB>1</SB> was the primary indicator of airflow obstruction. Baseline FEV<SB>1</SB> was defined as the best value between the third and sixth month after transplantation. For patients sampled before 3 months had elapsed after transplant, the baseline FEV<SB>1</SB> was defined as the best FEV<SB>1</SB> since transplant.</P></LV2>
<LV2><HD>Nitrite and Nitrate Assays</HD>
<P>We measured NO<SB>2</SB><SP>&hyphen;</SP> alone &lpar;before reduction of the samples&rpar; and total nitrite using the Griess reaction.<LK IDREF="R18-4">18</LK> Samples and standards were treated with nitrate reductase at 37&deg;C for 3 hours, time sufficient to convert all NO<SB>3</SB><SP>&hyphen;</SP> to measurable NO<SB>2</SB><SP>&hyphen;</SP>. One percent sulfanilamide and 0.02&percnt; <E T="I">N</E>&hyphen;&lpar;1&hyphen;naphthyl&rpar;ethylenediamine were added. Absorbance at 550 nm was read and sample concentrations calculated from standards. Nitrate concentration was then obtained by subtracting the value before reduction &lpar;NO<SB>2</SB><SP>&hyphen;</SP>&rpar; from the value after reduction &lpar;NO<SB>2</SB><SP>&hyphen;</SP>&plus;NO<SB>3</SB><SP>&hyphen;</SP>&rpar;.</P></LV2>
<LV2><HD>Urea</HD>
<P>Concentration of urea in BALF was used to estimate the degree of dilution of ELF by the lavage fluid.<LK IDREF="R19-4">19</LK> The calculated dilution then was used to estimate concentrations of molecules of interest in ELF. A blood sample was obtained on the day of bronchoscopy for measurement of serum urea. Urea concentration in BALF and serum was measured using a UV assay kit from Sigma Chemical Co &lpar;St Louis, Mo&rpar;. Urea concentration was determined by using urease to convert urea to ammonia and CO<SB>2</SB>. Ammonia reacts with &agr;&hyphen;ketoglutarate to form glutamic acid, while consuming nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide. Disappearance of nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide was followed in a spectrophotometer at 340 nm.</P></LV2>
<LV2><HD>Myeloperoxidase Enzyme&hyphen;Linked Immunosorbent Assay</HD>
<P>We used the Bioxytech&reg; MPO&hyphen;EIA Assay System &lpar;OXIS International, Portland, Ore&rpar; for human MPO, in which MPO antigen is captured by a solid phase monoclonal antibody and detected with a biotin&hyphen;labeled goat polyclonal antibody to MPO.<LK IDREF="R20-4">20</LK> Avidin&hyphen;conjugated alkaline phosphatase binds to the biotinylated antibody to MPO. The alkaline phosphatase substrate, &Dgr;&hyphen;nitrophenyl phosphate, was added, and absorbance of the product &lpar;&Dgr;&hyphen;nitrophenol&rpar; was monitored at 405 nm. MPO concentration was calculated from a standard curve &lpar;0&hyphen;100 ng&sol;mL&rpar;. The detection limit of this assay is &ap;1.5 ng MPO&sol;mL.</P></LV2></LV1>

<P>The study population consisted of 22 males and 18 females. Mean&plusmn;SD age of patients was 51&plusmn;13 years &lpar;range, 23&hyphen;65 years&rpar;. None of the patients smoked at the time of the study. Samples were obtained within a range of 29&hyphen;3428 days after transplantation. Twenty&hyphen;one patients had single&hyphen;lung, 14 had double&hyphen;lung, and five had heart&hyphen;lung transplants. Indications for transplantation included chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, Eisenmenger's syndrome, sarcoid, cystic fibrosis, &agr;&hyphen;1&hyphen;antitrypsin deficiency, primary pulmonary hypertension, and bronchoalveolar cell carcinoma.</P></LV2>
<LV2><HD>Urea Assay and Calculated Dilution of Epithelial Lining Fluid</HD>
<P>We used the measurement method described by Rennard et al<LK IDREF="R17-4">17</LK> to estimate the dilution of molecules in ELF by urea in simultaneously obtained serum and BALF. Calculated dilution factors then were used to estimate ELF total nitrite concentration.</P></LV2>
<LV2><HD>Bronchoalveolar Lavage Fluid Myeloperoxidase Concentration by Enzyme&hyphen;Linked Immunosorbent Assay</HD>
<P>We used a commercial assay for immunoreactive human MPO in BALF as a marker of neutrophil activation. The assay detected MPO in 30 of the 40 samples&semi; BALF MPO concentration was less than the detection limit of the assay &lpar;1.5 ng MPO&sol;mL&rpar; in the others.

<LV1><HD><E T="B">DISCUSSION</E></HD>
<P>Lung transplantation prolongs survival of patients with end&hyphen;stage lung diseases. Chronic rejection is the primary cause of allograft failure. Clinically, airway inflammation and fibrosis present as bronchiolitis obliterans syndrome, which is characterized by a progressive decline in expiratory airflow &lpar;FEV<SB>1</SB>&rpar;.<LK IDREF="R1-4">1</LK> Therefore, understanding mechanisms of inflammation that precedes fibrosis could be important in preventing graft loss. Bronchiolitis obliterans syndrome is associated with pathologically evident OB and is poorly responsive to medical therapy.<LK IDREF="R2-4">2</LK> Risk factors for OB in transplants include cytomegalovirus infection, HLA mismatches, and repeated episodes of acute rejection. Mechanisms that lead to graft inflammation and ultimate rejection are not understood completely.</P>
<P>Nitrogen oxides &lpar;NO<SB>x</SB>&rpar; may be important mediators of lung inflammation. These species can react with other molecules to form reactive compounds, including, but not limited to, peroxynitrite, nitrosamines, and S&hyphen;nitrosothiols.<LK IDREF="R21-4">21</LK> Inhibition of iNOS can minimize inflammation in some models of lung transplantation.<LK IDREF="R4-4">4</LK> We have hypothesized that increased RNS metabolites correlate with airway inflammation, so we prospectively sought associations among serum nitrite, airway inflammation, function, and pathology.</P>
<LV2><HD>Previous Observations</HD>
<P>Airway washings from lung transplant patients contained NT and chlorotyrosine &lpar;by high&hyphen;performance liquid chromatography&rpar;, markers of protein nitration and chlorination, respectively, which likely indicate inflammation.<LK IDREF="R10-4">10</LK> Those particular lung transplant patients had significantly increased total nitrite in BALF and serum, compared with controls. To extend the previous observations in a new data set, we obtained BALF and serum samples from a different group of 40 lung transplant patients and assayed RNS metabolites. We determined whether RNS metabolites, measured as NO<SB>2</SB><SP>&hyphen;</SP> in BALF or serum, correlated with indices of airway inflammation, including presence of neutrophils and MPO in BALF or with decreases in airway function &lpar;&Dgr;FEV<SB>1</SB>&rpar;.</P>
<P>Data from the present group of lung transplant patients confirms high concentrations of total nitrite &lpar;predominantly present as NO<SB>3</SB><SP>&hyphen;</SP>&rpar; in both BALF and serum.<LK IDREF="R22-4">22</LK> Notably, we now find that the concentration of total nitrite in serum correlates with total nitrite in lavage, as well as with other markers of airway inflammation, including BALF neutrophils and MPO. Serum nitrite also correlates with decrease in lung function, which is indicated by a decrease in FEV<SB>1</SB> from the best posttransplant value. When the &Dgr;FEV<SB>1</SB> is assumed to be dichotomous &lpar;ie, increases or decreases&rpar;, serum nitrite is found to have a sensitivity of 92&percnt;, a positive predictive value of 67&percnt;, and a negative predictive value of 67&percnt;. However, low specificity results in a number of patients with high serum nitrite but no decrease in airflow, possibly because serum nitrite increases before a decrease in &Dgr;FEV<SB>1</SB> can be measured. Further, analysis of the airway inflammation graded as ordered categorical outcome &lpar;ie, the B score from 0&hyphen;4&rpar; shows that serum nitrite is also associated with airway inflammation.</P>
<P>Increased RNS metabolites and airway inflammation clearly were not attributable to infection. Only 1 of the 40 patients had positive BALF stains or cultures&semi; the rest were not infected by usual clinical criteria&semi; the serum and BALF NO<SB>2</SB><SP>&hyphen;</SP> were not remarkably high in the infected individual. We propose, on the basis of these data, that increased serum nitrite may precede impaired airway function. Thus, serum nitrite can be tested prospectively as a predictive index of airway inflammation.</P></LV2>
<LV2><HD>Reactive Nitrogen Species as Mediators of Inflammation</HD>
<P>Nitric oxide and the product of its reaction with superoxide, peroxynitrite anion, have been implicated strongly in lung allograft rejection.<LK IDREF="R23-4">23</LK> Nitric oxide production, assessed by serum nitrite measurements, increased during acute rejection in a rat lung transplant model. Aminoguanidine, an inhibitor of iNOS, decreased the severity of rat allograft rejection.<LK IDREF="R3-4">3</LK> In contrast, epithelial iNOS appeared in a heterotopic rat tracheal allograft model of chronic OB.<LK IDREF="R4-4">4</LK> Aminoguanidine appeared to worsen experimental OB in that setting, while L&hyphen;arginine, a precursor of &middot;NO, significantly reduced obliteration of tracheal lumens.</P>
<P>Airway ELF is adjacent to a rich source of &middot;NO, the respiratory epithelium, and may contain activated macrophages that produce superoxide and MPO. Nitric oxide can react extremely rapidly &lpar;on the order of 10<SP>9</SP> M<SP>&hyphen;</SP><SP>1</SP> s<SP>&hyphen;</SP><SP>1</SP>&rpar; with superoxide to form peroxynitrite, an oxidizing anion capable of nitrating proteins. Myeloperoxidase can also catalyze the formation of nitrating and chlorinating intermediates by using NO<SB>2</SB><SP>&hyphen;</SP>, hydrogen peroxide, or hypochlorite that may be derived from inflammatory cells.<LK IDREF="R12-4">12</LK></P>
<P>Nitration of ELF proteins may have functional implications. Exposure of surfactant to RNS decreases its ability to lower surface tension.<LK IDREF="R13-4">13</LK> Exposure of surfactant in protein A &lpar;SP&hyphen;A&rpar; to peroxynitrite decreased its ability to aggregate lipids and interact with SP&hyphen;B and SP&hyphen;C to lower surface tension. Surfactant recovered from sheep that were exposed to high concentrations of &middot;NO &lpar;80&hyphen;200 ppm&rpar; failed to reach a low surface tension.<LK IDREF="R24-4">24</LK> Nitration can interfere with signaling pathways that involve tyrosine kinase phosphorylation. For example, peroxynitrite nitrates two tyrosines in a synthetic peptide that corresponds to phosphorylation sites in a lymphocyte tyrosine kinase.<LK IDREF="R25-4">25</LK> Nitration completely inhibits phosphorylation and may, thus, impair signal transduction.</P></LV2>
<LV2><HD>Myeloperoxidase in Bronchoalveolar Lavage Fluid</HD>
<P>Activated polymorphonuclear cells secrete MPO, which uses hydrogen peroxide to produce hypochlorous acid &lpar;HOCl&rpar;. Chlorination of tyrosine, which is a marker of neutrophilic inflammation, occurs in BALF of lung transplant patients.<LK IDREF="R10-4">10</LK> Chlorotyrosine is a specific product of MPO&hyphen;catalyzed oxidative damage and may be formed by reaction of NO<SB>2</SB><SP>&hyphen;</SP> and HOCl, but HOCl can chlorinate without NO<SB>2</SB><SP>&hyphen;</SP>.<LK IDREF="R26-4">26</LK> Recently, it has been shown that NO<SB>2</SB><SP>&hyphen;</SP>, which is the primary metabolic end product of &middot;NO, may undergo MPO&hyphen;catalyzed oxidation to form nitrogen dioxide &lpar;NO<SB>2</SB>&rpar;. NO<SB>2</SB> may be another important mechanism of nitration as well as participate in host defense.</P>
<P>We found both neutrophils and immunoreactive MPO in BALF. Because these patients are immunosuppressed and infection is common, we carefully sought infection by reviewing all cultures and stains obtained at bronchoscopies. Only one of 40 patients had documented infection. That patient had only 4&percnt; neutrophils and had a relatively low MPO concentration &lpar;0.062 &mgr;g immunoreactive MPO&sol;mg protein&rpar;. Logistic regression analysis revealed no correlations between the presence or absence of infection and levels of serum nitrite, BALF NO<SB>2</SB><SP>&hyphen;</SP>, or neutrophils, and MPO. These data further suggest that increased RNS metabolites reflect graft inflammation rather than infection.</P></LV2>
<LV2><HD>Serum Nitrite as a Marker</HD>
<P>In these 40 patients, we found that serum nitrite had good predictive power for physiological evidence of airway dysfunction, categorized as a decrease in FEV<SB>1</SB>. Serum nitrite correlates with cellular and biochemical markers of airway inflammation, including the concentration of total nitrite in BALF, the percentage of neutrophils and MPO in BALF, in addition to the &Dgr;FEV<SB>1</SB>. Other investigators have found elevated RNS metabolites in airway secretions during acute pulmonary infection in cystic fibrosis<LK IDREF="R27-4">27</LK> and asthma exacerbations.<LK IDREF="R28-4">28</LK> No other investigators have, to our knowledge, used serum nitrite measurements to assess lung inflammation or pathogenesis.</P>
<P>An important finding is that serum nitrite appears to reflect RNS in the BALF, and so it may serve as a surrogate for direct sampling of lavage fluid in assessment of airway inflammation. As described above, neither the serum nitrite concentration nor its relationship to BALF neutrophils can be attributed to infection, because only one of these 40 patients had documented infection.</P></LV2>
<LV2><HD>Conclusions</HD>
<P>We herein demonstrate a correlation between elevated serum levels of RNS and altered airway physiology, as shown by &Dgr;FEV<SB>1</SB>. These findings support the concept that serum levels of RNS metabolites may be useful noninvasive markers of airway inflammation.</P></LV2></LV1>

<LV1><HD><E T="B">INTRODUCTION</E></HD>
<P>In chronic maintenance dialysis, the need for rhEPO is widely recognized<LK IDREF="R1-5 R2-5">1,2</LK> as is the need for supplemental iron.<LK IDREF="R1-5 R3-5 R4-5 R5-5 R6-5 R7-5">1,3&ndash;7</LK> Yet, the mean hematocrit of hemodialysis patients in the United States in 1993 &lpar;0.301&rpar; increased only to 0.327 by 1996, while 28&percnt; of patients had hematocrits &lt;0.30.<LK IDREF="R8-5">8</LK> Clinical trials usually focus on selected populations and are not easily translated into practice, as shown recently for rhEPO use in patients treated by dialysis.<LK IDREF="R9-5">9</LK> Because dialysis patients have diverse underlying diseases and comorbid variables, we postulated that a long&hyphen;term observational approach might facilitate understanding of anemia management.</P>
<P>This study describes the use of an observational approach to improve timeliness and accuracy of data collection as well as analysis in anemia management in dialysis patients. Objectives were to identify and correct iron deficiency, and to assess effects of interventions on patient well being. Oral iron supplements failed to correct anemia and iron deficiency, but intravenous iron supplements led to greater improvement than anticipated. Analysis of dynamic changes over time made it possible to identify hematologic parameters that predict iron deficiency and response to intravenous iron administration. Unexpectedly, intravenous iron treatment was associated with striking macrocytosis. When patients were divided into quartiles by MCV at study onset, a significant response to intravenous iron occurred only in quartile 1, although macrocytosis developed in all quartiles.</P>
<P>Intravenous iron administration was also associated with increased serum albumin, decreased blood pressure, and an increase in creatinine&sol;kg body weight &lpar;an index of muscle mass in functionally anephric patients&rpar;. When patients were characterized by serum ferritin<LK IDREF="R10-5">10</LK> before intravenous iron repletion, these changes in blood pressure and serum creatinine&sol;kg body weight occurred only in the lower ferritin subset.</P></LV1>
<LV1><HD><E T="B">METHODS</E></HD>
<LV2><HD>Patients and Routine Method of Treatment</HD>
<P>Upper Manhattan Dialysis Center &lpar;UMDC&rpar; provides dialysis services for patients from St Luke's, Columbia&hyphen;Presbyterian and other hospitals in New York City. By January 1996, 206 patients were treated for end&hyphen;stage renal failure. The 172 treated by hemodialysis &lpar;for an average time of 200 minutes thrice weekly&rpar; received rhEPO &lpar;Epoietin alfa, Epogen&reg;&semi; Amgen, Thousand Oaks, Calif&rpar; intravenously with each treatment. A polysaccharide&hyphen;iron complex containing 150 mg elemental iron, 1 mg folic acid, and 25 &mgr;g vitamin B12 &lpar;Niferex&reg;&hyphen;150 Forte&semi; Central Pharmaceuticals, Seymour, Ind&rpar; was prescribed for most patients. This is the only oral iron preparation reimbursed by New York State Medicaid. Dose and timing of rhEPO and iron varied as prescribed by eight attending nephrologists.</P></LV2>
<LV2><HD>Computerized Data Collection and Retrieval</HD>
<P>In the last trimester of 1994, UMDC installed Disease Manager Plus &lpar;MIQS&reg;, Inc, Boulder, Colo&rpar;, a patient&hyphen;centered medical information system. The database fully integrates an analyzable computer&hyphen;based patient record, data repository, and practice management functions. By June 1995 it had replaced the paper chart entirely and included automated electronic download and validation of laboratory test results.</P></LV2>
<LV2><HD>Selection of Patients for Iron Administration</HD>
<P>Initial analysis in December 1995 revealed a median hematocrit of 0.309, comparable to that then prevalent in the US dialysis population. Macrocytosis &lpar;MCV&gt;98 fL&rpar; was found in 8&percnt; of patients. Red cells indices suggestive of iron deficiency &lpar;MCH&lt;26 pg, MCV&lt;80 fL&rpar; were present in 10&hyphen;15&percnt;. In January 1996 it was decided to approach iron administration systematically in all patients. First, iron &lpar;Niferex&rpar; was prescribed by mouth at night when the stomach was empty and free of phosphate binders. Effects were assessed by examination of hematological data in monthly individual patient reports. By October 1996 it was apparent that this therapy was inadequate. In the planned second study phase, iron dextran &lpar;InFeD&reg;&semi; Schein Pharmaceutical, Florham Park, NJ&rpar; was administered intravenously to anemic patients with laboratory findings that suggest iron deficiency &lpar;transferrin saturation &lt;20&percnt; and&sol;or serum ferritin &lt;100 ng&sol;mL&rpar;. Most received courses of 1 g of elemental iron, consisting of 10 successive 100&hyphen;mg &lpar;2&hyphen;mL&rpar; infusions at the end of treatment sessions. Succeeding courses were given if iron deficiency persisted. Results of routine laboratory tests &lpar;complete blood count, tests of iron status, and a serum chemistry panel&rpar;, done early in the first week of each month, were downloaded electronically, reviewed within 72 hours of testing, and hematinic medications adjusted as required. When hematocrit increased, rhEPO dose was tapered. Because rhEPO reimbursement was at the time disallowed when hematocrit was &gt;0.36,<LK IDREF="R11-5">11</LK> the striking response after intravenous iron made it difficult to continue the original protocol. The study was initially terminated on June 30, 1997, but patients were followed in detail until December 31, 1997.</P></LV2>
<LV2><HD>Selection of Patients for Longitudinal Analysis</HD>
<P>In January 1997, 10 weeks after the first patients received iron intravenously, a preliminary analysis revealed striking changes in hematological and iron parameters in some patients, variation in individual patients though time, and patient&hyphen;to&hyphen;patient variation. Although data on all patients were analyzed, a prospective analysis of retrospectively collected data on patients followed for &gt;1 year became a principal analytical focus. With a minimum 12&hyphen;month prospective follow&hyphen;up, it was predicted that perspective on treatment effects might be achieved. Patients &lpar;n&equals;160&rpar; who were alive in January 1997 were initially identified. Patients with AIDS &lpar;n&equals;11&rpar; or myeloma &lpar;n&equals;1&rpar; were excluded. The final population was 102 patients with laboratory data from January 1996 or earlier&semi; 87 were undergoing hemodialysis and are the subjects of this analysis. Fifty&hyphen;one were male. Twenty&hyphen;four patients were Caucasian, 62 were African American, and one was Native American. Median age was 58.5 years&semi; 65 had Medicare insurance or were Medicare eligible, and 22 had Medicaid only. The median duration of dialysis treatment before the start of the study was 15 months. The cause of end&hyphen;stage renal disease was hypertensive renal disease in 33, diabetic nephropathy in 28, and glomerulonephritis in 12 subjects. In January 1996, 85 were receiving rhEPO&semi; none was receiving intravenous iron. A dietician participated in the care of all patients and reviewed their nutritional status monthly. Social workers also participated actively in their care and took all necessary steps to ensure access to appropriate nutrition.</P></LV2>
<LV2><HD>Data Abstraction and Analysis</HD>
<P>All analyses were done by one author &lpar;V.E.P.&rpar;, who was ignorant of treatment details, knowing only that most patients were treated with rhEPO and had received oral iron for a long period before being switched to intravenous iron dextran. Data abstracted for 1&hyphen; to 12&hyphen;month periods were exported into a tab&hyphen;delimited text file and imported for further analysis into SAS JMP&reg; &lpar;version 3.2&semi; SAS Institute, Inc, Cary, NC&rpar;. Laboratory data were tested for normality of distribution with the Shapiro Wilk <E T="I">W</E> test. Those conforming to a normal distribution after logarithmic transformation were analyzed after logarithmic transformation. To provide clinically relevant information on oral iron treatment in individual patients, mean values for each were calculated for the first 3 months &lpar;January&hyphen;March 1996&rpar; and for two successive trimesters &lpar;April&hyphen;June and July&hyphen;September 1996&rpar; during oral iron administration. Here, mean values in the last trimester of oral iron treatment &lpar;July&hyphen;September 1996&rpar; are compared with those in the first &lpar;January&hyphen;March 1996&rpar;. To assess the effect of intravenous iron treatment in individual patients, mean values for each were calculated for the last initially planned trimester &lpar;April&hyphen;June 1997&rpar; of intravenous iron and compared with those of the last trimester of oral iron treatment &lpar;July&hyphen;September 1996&rpar;. Another comparison was made with data obtained in the final trimester &lpar;October&hyphen;December 1997&rpar;. Mean values were compared using the paired <E T="I">t</E> test for normally distributed data, or with the Wilcoxon signed&hyphen;rank test for data not normally distributed. Other analyses were done by analysis of variance. Mean values of non&hyphen;paired data were compared using Student's <E T="I">t</E> test.</P></LV2></LV1>
<LV1><HD><E T="B">RESULTS</E></HD>
<P>Selection ensured that all 87 patients who entered the study on January 1, 1996, were alive in early January 1997&semi; 67 were still followed on December 31, 1997. Of the other 20, one received a kidney transplant, seven transferred to other dialysis units, and 12 &lpar;mean age, 66 years&semi; range, 51&hyphen;86 years&rpar; died.</P>
<LV2><HD>Treatment With Oral Iron</HD>
<P>There were statistically significant but very small and poorly sustained increases in hemoglobin concentration &lpar;&plus;2.58 g&sol;L&rpar; and erythrocyte count &lpar;&plus;0.16 10<SP>12</SP>&sol;L&rpar;. Mean MCV and MCH decreased slightly &lpar;<E T="I">P</E>&lt;0.05 and <E T="I">P</E>&lt;0.01, respectively&rpar;. Transferrin saturation changed little, but median serum ferritin decreased by 23&percnt; from 111 ng&sol;mL &lpar;<E T="I">P</E>&lt;0.001&rpar;. During oral iron treatment, the amount of blood processed increased significantly by 0.08 L&sol;kg from 1.04 L&sol;kg. Postdialysis weight, serum creatinine, serum albumin, mean arterial pressure &lpar;MAP&rpar;, urea reduction ratio, and Kt&sol;V changed little.</P></LV2>
<LV2><HD>Treatment With Intravenous Iron</HD>
<P>Between October 1996 and June 1997, 85 patients received iron dextran intravenously. The mean total dose of elemental iron per patient was 2960 mg &lpar;range, 900&hyphen;5400 mg given during a 9&hyphen;month period&rpar;. Mean hematocrit increased to 0.366, mean hemoglobin concentration to 110.5 g&sol;L &lpar;<E T="I">P</E>&lt;0.01&rpar;, and erythrocyte count to 3.88 10<SP>12</SP>&sol;L &lpar;<E T="I">P</E>&lt;0.001&rpar;. MCV increased continuously to 95.6 fL &lpar;<E T="I">P</E>&lt;0.001&rpar;, greater than one standard deviation above the normal mean &lpar;<LK IDREF="T1-5">Table 1</LK>&rpar;. Concurrently, mean corpuscular hemoglobin concentration &lpar;MCHC&rpar; decreased to 301 g&sol;L &lpar;<E T="I">P</E>&lt;0.001&rpar;. Improvement was sustained over the next 6 months, ending with the October through December 1997 trimester. Iron saturation and ferritin increased significantly &lpar;<E T="I">P</E>&lt;0.001 for each&rpar; &lpar;<LK IDREF="T1-5">Table 1</LK>&rpar;.</P>
<TB ID="T1-5"><TI><E T="BIT">Table 1 Differences between hematological values in the last trimester of oral iron administration and at 6&hyphen;9 and 12&hyphen;15 months after intravenous iron administration was started in patients studied longitudinally.</E></TI><TGP FILE="G5TT1"></TB>
<P>Dialysis parameters are shown in <LK IDREF="T2-5">Table 2</LK>. Postdialysis weight decreased significantly by the last study trimester. Serum creatinine and serum albumin both increased significantly. There was a very small increase in urea reduction ratio, Kt&sol;V, and the amount of blood processed. MAP increased slightly in approximately the first 4 months of intravenous iron treatment. The mean change in MAP in the fourth trimester was &plus;1.23 mm Hg pre&hyphen;dialysis, and &hyphen;0.22 mm Hg postdialysis&semi; in the fifth trimester, the mean changes were &plus;1.04 and &plus;0.92 mm Hg, respectively. Thereafter, there was a slow decline in MAP, more clearly delineated in the posthemodialysis MAP &lpar;<LK IDREF="T2-5">Table 2</LK>&rpar;. The decline in postdialysis MAP was significant in the sixth &lpar;3&percnt;, <E T="I">P</E>&lt;0.05&rpar;, seventh &lpar;3.4&percnt;, <E T="I">P</E>&lt;0.01&rpar;, and eighth trimesters &lpar;4.5&percnt;, <E T="I">P</E>&lt;0.001&rpar;.</P>

<LV2><HD>Changes in Mean Corpuscular Volume</HD>
<P>Increase of MCV from low to mid&hyphen;normal levels was expected in iron deficient patients undergoing iron repletion. Shortly after intravenous iron treatment began, it became apparent that the effect on MCV in many patients was greater than expected. One particular patient &lpar;<LK IDREF="F1-5">Figure 1</LK>&rpar; drew attention to the large MCV changes. This 37&hyphen;year&hyphen;old man with renal failure caused by Type 1 diabetes mellitus started chronic hemodialysis treatment on November 1, 1995. He was severely anemic and profoundly iron deficient &lpar;hemoglobin 66 g&sol;L, MCV 73 fL, MCH 20.4 pg, transferrin saturation 4&percnt;, serum ferritin 29 ng&sol;mL&rpar;. As oral iron failed to correct the problem, intravenous iron was started on November 8, 1996. He received 1000 mg in November, 1700 mg between January and March 1997, 900 mg in June 1997. Hemoglobin, MCV, MCH, and transferrin saturation increased promptly. Hemoglobin and MCV increased to maximum levels of 176 g&sol;L and 118 fL, respectively, in April 1997. MCV was &gt;100 fL in all 23 samples measured from January to December 1997.</P>
<FG ID="F1-5" FILE="G5FF1"><P><E T="BIT">Figure 1</E> <E T="I">Findings in a single patient over 24 months. Hemoglobin &lpar;Hb&rpar; and mean corpuscular volume &lpar;MCV&rpar; rose rapidly from low to above normal levels after intravenous iron was started, despite a great decrease in the dose of erythropoietin &lpar;EPO&rpar;. MCH &equals; mean corpuscular hemoglobin.</E></P></FG>
<P>This observation prompted systematic assessment of MCV after intravenous iron was given. MCV was &gt;98 fL in 4.3&percnt; of samples from January to November 1996, in 15&percnt; in December,1996, and in 21&percnt; in January 1997. Each month from February to December 1997, MCV was &gt;98 fL in &gt;30&percnt; of samples.</P></LV2>
<LV2><HD>Mean Corpuscular Volume in Other Dialysis Patients</HD>
<P>The longitudinally studied patients were compared with 84 UMDC patients not participating in the longitudinal study and with 710 patients in four other dialysis units that used the patient&hyphen;centered medical information system &lpar;<LK IDREF="T3-5 T4-5">Tables 3 and 4</LK>&rpar;. In dialysis unit no. 4, the mean MCV was in the expected range, and only 12.3&percnt; of samples had an MCV &gt;98 fL. In dialysis unit nos. 1, 2, and 3, mean MCV was elevated, and MCV was &gt;98 fL in 32.7&percnt; of 2274 samples&semi; the 3&hyphen;month patient mean was elevated in 29.2&percnt; of 658 patients.</P>
<TB ID="T3-5"><TI><E T="BIT">Table 3 Occurrence of an elevated MCV &lpar;&gt;98 fL&rpar; in five dialysis units.</E></TI><TGP FILE="G5TT3"></TB>
<TB ID="T4-5"><TI><E T="BIT">Table 4 Selected findings in the last trimester of oral iron administration and at 6&hyphen;9 and 12&hyphen;15 months after intravenous iron administration was started in patients not studied longitudinally.</E></TI><TGP FILE="G5TT4"></TB>
<P>These findings led us to the postulate that a deficiency or disorder of metabolism of folate might be more common than hitherto thought. As MCV is the red cell index primarily affected by iron and folic acid deficiency, the data of the longitudinally studied patients were reanalyzed as a function of MCV at study start. The January 1996 findings were used to divide patients by four MCV quartiles &lpar;quartile 1, MCV 73&hyphen;82.9 fL&semi; quartile 2, MCV 83&hyphen;86.9 fL&semi; quartile 3, MCV 87&hyphen;92.9 fL&semi; quartile 4, MCV 93&hyphen;103 fL&rpar;.</P></LV2>
<LV2><HD>Quartiles at Start of Study</HD>
<P>There were proportionately more males in quartile 1 than in the other three &lpar;&khgr;<SP>2</SP><SB>&lsqb;1&rsqb;</SB>&equals;4.70, <E T="I">P</E>&lt;0.05&rpar;. Age, race, and insurance were distributed similarly in all quartiles. Duration of prior dialysis treatment was similar in all quartiles. There was no difference in distribution of primary disease. Patients in quartile 1 had the most striking evidence of iron deficiency &lpar;<LK IDREF="T5-5">Table 5</LK>&rpar; at outset, and MCH and transferrin saturation were low. Transferrin saturation in 12 patients was &lt;16&percnt;, at which level effective iron transport would not be expected.</P>
<TB ID="T5-5"><TI><E T="BIT">Table 5 Hematological values &lpar;mean&plusmn;SEM&rpar; in the initial 3&hyphen;month period, January&hyphen;March, 1996, for patients studied longitudinally and arrayed by four MCV quartiles.</E></TI><TGP FILE="G5TT5"></TB>
<P>Hemoglobin was slightly higher in each successive quartile, as were MCH and transferrin saturation. By contrast, serum ferritin was similar in each quartile. When quartiles 3 and 4 were compared with quartiles 1 and 2, the proportion of patients with MCH and transferrin saturation values below the lower limits of normal differed significantly &lpar;MCH &khgr;<SP>2</SP><SB>&lsqb;1&rsqb;</SB>&equals;16.72, <E T="I">P</E>&lt;0.001&semi; transferrin saturation &khgr;<SP>2</SP><SB>&lsqb;1&rsqb;</SB>&equals;12.22, <E T="I">P</E>&lt;0.001&rpar;, but the proportion with low&hyphen;ferritin values did not &lpar;&khgr;<SP>2</SP><SB>&lsqb;1&rsqb;</SB>&equals;0.015, <E T="I">P</E>&gt;0.90&rpar;.</P>
<P>When the effect of oral iron was examined by individual quartiles, there was a decrease in MCV and MCH only in quartile 4, whereas serum ferritin decreased in all. The small increment in hemoglobin was associated with a slight decrease in red cell size and hemoglobin content, and with a significant decrease in iron stores. When the effect of intravenous iron administration was examined by individual quartiles, hemoglobin and red blood cell increases were significant only in quartile 1 at the 3&hyphen; to 6&hyphen;month and 9&hyphen; to 12&hyphen;month periods &lpar;<LK IDREF="F2-5">Figure 2</LK>&rpar;. Increase in transferrin saturation was greatest in quartile 1, minimal in quartile 4. MCV increased significantly &lpar;<E T="I">P</E>&lt;0.001&rpar; and MCHC decreased significantly &lpar;<E T="I">P</E>&lt;0.001&rpar; in all quartiles.

<LV2><HD>Iron Stores and the Effects of Intravenous Iron</HD>
<P>In chronic hemodialysis patients, serum ferritin reflects total body iron stores. To explore the effects of iron repletion, the patients were divided into two equal&hyphen;sized subsets based on median serum ferritin in the 9&hyphen;month period of January though September 1996, when iron was given by mouth. In the low&hyphen;ferritin subset, median serum ferritin ranged from 15 to 88 ng&sol;mL, in the high subset from 89 to 853 ng&sol;mL. Hemoglobin, serum albumin, urea reduction ratio, Kt&sol;V and the amount of blood processed in each treatment were identical in the two subsets, as was MAP &lpar;<E T="I">P</E>&gt;0.5, for each&rpar;. Serum creatinine was lower in the low&hyphen; &lpar;12.03&plusmn;0.56 &mgr;mol&sol;L&sol;kg&rpar; than in the high&hyphen; &lpar;14.33&plusmn;0.81 &mgr;mol&sol;L&sol;kg&rpar; ferritin subset &lpar;t<SB>&lsqb;81&rsqb;</SB>&equals;2.33, <E T="I">P</E>&lt;0.05&rpar;. The total amount of iron given intravenously was similar in low&hyphen; and high&hyphen;ferritin subsets &lpar;<LK IDREF="F3-5">Figure 3</LK>&rpar;. A significant increase in serum albumin occurred in both ferritin subsets. The increase in serum creatinine was significant in the low&hyphen;ferritin subset only. Also, the decrease in diastolic and mean arterial pressures occurred only in the low&hyphen;ferritin subset.</P>

<LV2><HD>Potential Adverse Effects</HD>
<P>Hemosiderosis, usually preceded by prolonged high serum ferritin elevation, is associated with repeated parenteral iron administration. Prolonged high elevation of serum ferritin was infrequent. Three or more values &gt;1000 ng&sol;mL occurred in nine patients, three of whom had high serum ferritin levels before intravenous iron. Overall, serum ferritin levels &gt;1000 ng&sol;mL were recorded in 3.26&percnt; of 1791 specimens in 20 patients. Reactions associated with iron administration by vein were not encountered. One patient developed gastrointestinal bleeding during the oral iron replacement phase, and a second during intravenous iron replacement. Of 109 stool examinations for occult blood during this study, only one was positive.</P></LV2>
<LV2><HD>Hospitalization and Mortality</HD>
<P>Hospitalization and mortality rates are important outcome measures, but the data must be interpreted with caution because of the small number of patients and relatively short follow&hyphen;up period. All 102 patients were included in the calculations, ie, 87 treated by hemodialysis and 15 treated by peritoneal dialysis. Patients studied longitudinally were in the hospital for an average of 14.9 days per year at risk during the 33&hyphen;month period January 1, 1997, to September 30, 1999. This is 19.5&percnt; lower than the 1996 rate of 18.5 days. A similar trend was observed when the rate was calculated for all patients treated at UMDC &lpar;studied longitudinally and cross&hyphen;sectionally&rpar;, excluding those with AIDS. The average hospital stay of 7.7 days was 29&percnt; lower than the historical average of 10.9 days. Twenty&hyphen;eight patients died in the 33&hyphen;month period, a mortality rate of 128.7 per 1000 years at risk. This is 31&percnt; lower than the facility's historical 1995&hyphen;1996 mortality rate of 186.6 per 1000 years.</P></LV2>
<LV2><HD>Patients Not Studied Longitudinally</HD>
<P>The study patients had been treated by dialysis for a median of 15 months before the start of the study. The remaining dialysis patients included many in whom hemodialysis treatment was started recently. To test whether the findings and trends were similar in this patient population, not studied longitudinally, the data were analyzed for all other patients treated by hemodialysis &lpar;excluding those with AIDS&rpar;. Selected results are shown in <LK IDREF="T4-5">Table 4</LK>. Differences between the time periods were analyzed using Student's <E T="I">t</E> test for unpaired observations. Trends were similar in direction to those in patients studied longitudinally. There was a small increment in the number of erythrocytes and in serum creatinine&sol;kg. Of particular note was the statistically significant increase in serum albumin and in MCV, confirming the observations in the study group.</P></LV2></LV1>
<LV1><HD><E T="B">DISCUSSION</E></HD>
<LV2><HD>Anemia</HD>
<P>The requirement for iron to sustain the erythroid response to rhEPO was observed more than 10 years ago.<LK IDREF="R1-5 R2-5">1,2</LK> The present study provides further evidence for failure of oral iron to correct the iron deficiency in hemodialysis patients.<LK IDREF="R4-5 R7-5">4,7</LK> Nephrologists have long used intravenous iron in dialysis patients. Although intravenous iron continues to be recommended in dialysis patients on rhEPO,<LK IDREF="R11-5 R12-5">11,12</LK> comparison of the present data with the mean hemoglobin of US dialysis patients &lpar;noted above&rpar; suggests that this recommendation has not been translated effectively into daily practice.</P>
<P>During oral iron administration, a very small hemoglobin increase was accompanied by a decrease in MCV and MCH and was related inversely to change in ferritin &lpar;<E T="I">F</E><SB>&lsqb;2,79&rsqb;</SB>&equals;6.76, <E T="I">P</E>&lt;0.002&rpar;, indicating further depletion of iron stores as well as iron&hyphen;deficient erythropoiesis. The improved hematopoietic response after intravenous iron re&hyphen;emphasizes the importance of impaired iron availability as a component of anemia in dialysis patients.<LK IDREF="R3-5 R4-5 R5-5 R6-5 R7-5 R13-5">3&ndash;7,13</LK></P>
<P>Dividing patients at outset into four MCV quartiles facilitated understanding of responses to intravenous iron administration. One quartile with an unequivocal hemoglobin response to intravenous iron repletion was highlighted. MCV increased with intravenous iron administration in all quartiles, whether erythrocytes were small, normal, or large at outset &lpar;<LK IDREF="F2-5">Figure 2</LK>&rpar;. This increase was expected in iron&hyphen;deficient patients with small erythrocytes. Although a slight increase in red cell size was reported in hemodialysis patients treated with parenteral iron but not with rhEPO,<LK IDREF="R14-5">14</LK> the rapid development and persistence of macrocytosis in some patients was not anticipated. Its persistence makes it unlikely that macrocytosis was caused by a burst of reticulocytes, although this parameter was not measured prospectively.</P>
<P>On the basis primarily of changes in transferrin saturation and MCHC, it has been proposed that rhEPO induces functional iron deficiency in dialysis patients.<LK IDREF="R15-5">15</LK> We observed these changes but suggest a different interpretation. The MCHC decline, with stable MCH, primarily reflects the striking MCV increase &lpar;<LK IDREF="F4-5">Figure 4</LK>&rpar;, a feature not characteristic of iron deficiency. Given the association of folate deficiency with anemia in dialysis patients,<LK IDREF="R16-5 R17-5">16,17</LK> we suggest that the MCV increase is a marker of inadequately treated folate deficiency unmasked by an adequate iron supply<LK IDREF="R18-5">18</LK> and that decreased MCHC is consequent on this MCV change. Serum folate &lpar;n&equals;176&rpar; and vitamin B12 and red blood cell folate &lpar;n&equals;15&rpar; levels were normal or high. This does not preclude a potential role for folate, as increased hematocrit and a concurrent decrease in high MCV may occur when 10 mg of folate is administered daily for 3&hyphen;4 months to dialysis patients with normal or high serum folate levels.<LK IDREF="R17-5">17</LK> These levels might be explained by endogenous or exogenous inhibitors of folic acid in blood in renal failure.<LK IDREF="R19-5">19</LK> There is clearly need for systematic evaluation of the effects of large doses of folate, particularly in light of the recent report that concluded that elevated plasma homocysteine levels are common in dialysis patients.<LK IDREF="R20-5">20</LK> Doses of folate greater than 1 mg&sol;d were not administered in this study.</P>
<FG ID="F4-5" FILE="G5FF4"><P><E T="BIT">Figure 4</E> <E T="I">Inverse relationship between mean corpuscular volume &lpar;MCV&rpar; and mean corpuscular hemoglobin concentration &lpar;MCHC&rpar;. The values are means for each of the 24 months of study.</E></P></FG>
<P>We also suggest that decreased transferrin saturation does not solely reflect a reduction in the iron available for erythropoiesis but is a consequence of improved protein synthesis. Transferrin is a marker of nutritional status in dialysis patients.<LK IDREF="R21-5">21</LK> Both transferrin and albumin increased into normal ranges following intravenous iron. Decreased transferrin saturation may, therefore, reflect, at least in part, an enhanced anabolic state and an increment in transferrin concentration rather than a decrement in iron availability.</P>
<P>There was no clear association of response to iron with any demographic or comorbid factors. Several other findings known to affect bone marrow function in renal failure were analyzed. There was no relationship between hemoglobin increment following intravenous iron and serum calcium, phosphorus, calcium&hyphen;phosphorus product, alkaline phosphatase, intact parathyroid hormone, or aluminum levels &lpar;<E T="I">P</E>&gt;0.2 for each&rpar;.</P>
<P>Although patients with a higher MCV had a much smaller increment in hemoglobin in response to iron, they also showed the MCV increment that was observed in all patients in the study. This implies that some impairment of erythrocyte iron metabolism is present in virtually all chronic renal failure patients.</P></LV2>
<LV2><HD>Diagnosis of Iron Deficiency Anemia</HD>
<P>Absence of stainable iron on a Prussian blue&hyphen;stained marrow aspirate is the traditional gold standard for diagnosis of iron deficiency. In the present study, we used hemoglobin response to intravenous iron to operationally decide whether iron deficiency anemia was present at outset. That this is a valid assumption is supported by the hemoglobin response to intravenous iron. It was significant and sustained only in quartile 1, despite a 52&percnt; decrease in weekly rhEPO &lpar;<LK IDREF="F2-5">Figure 2</LK>&rpar;.</P>
<P>Low MCV and low transferrin saturation are traditional diagnostic criteria for iron deficiency anemia, but it has been suggested that low serum ferritin and low transferrin saturation may be more valid as criteria in chronic renal failure.<LK IDREF="R11-5">11</LK> Nevertheless, the lower limit of normal for serum ferritin in dialysis patients should probably be set higher than that for otherwise healthy individuals.<LK IDREF="R22-5 R23-5">22,23</LK> Because peak hemoglobin, and presumably peak intravenous iron response, may have occurred before or at study close, we calculated the maximum mean hemoglobin for each trimester of 1997. The maximum increase in any trimester was chosen as the end point for measuring the response.</P>
<P>Age, sex, race, and diabetes mellitus had no effect on response &lpar;<E T="I">P</E>&gt; 0.4 for each&rpar;. Only three findings at the outset were predictive of subsequent hemoglobin response to intravenous iron&colon; MCV quartile &lpar;<E T="I">P</E>&lt;0.005&rpar;&semi; MCH &lpar;<E T="I">P</E>&equals;0.008&rpar;&semi; and transferrin saturation &lpar;<E T="I">P</E>&lt;0.001&rpar;&semi; The first two are indicators of erythrocyte iron metabolism&semi; the third indicates iron availability for erythropoiesis. Serum ferritin, a predictor of iron stores, was a poor predictor of subsequent hemoglobin response &lpar;<E T="I">P</E>&equals;0.08&rpar;.</P>
<P>Low serum ferritin levels appear to provide very strong evidence for decreased iron stores in these patients. Dividing patients at outset into two equal&hyphen;sized subsets facilitated understanding of the role of iron stores. The division occurred at a serum ferritin level of 88 ng&sol;mL, approximating the proposed lower limit of normal &lpar;100 ng&sol;mL&rpar; for patients treated by dialysis.<LK IDREF="R22-5 R23-5">22,23</LK> At the outset, the two subsets were similar in most respects. Serum creatinine, measured as &mgr;mol&sol;L&sol;kg, was less in the lower&hyphen;ferritin subset, suggesting less muscle mass. A striking increment in serum creatinine occurred in this subset only.</P>
<P>Improvement in serum albumin and muscle mass with intravenous iron has not &lpar;to our knowledge&rpar; been reported previously in adults. The increment in serum creatinine was statistically significant only in the low&hyphen;ferritin subset&semi; ie, the subset with a low serum creatinine before intravenous iron was started. Iron is essential for oxidation&hyphen;reduction catalysis and bioenergetics,<LK IDREF="R24-5">24</LK> and activity of a variety of iron&hyphen;containing enzymes of intermediary metabolism can be impaired in iron deficiency.<LK IDREF="R25-5">25</LK> Improvement in muscle mass may be a consequence of correction of such a problem. Hypoalbuminemia occurs occasionally in iron&hyphen;deficient children and is also rectified by iron replacement.<LK IDREF="R26-5">26</LK> These findings are typically attributed to malabsorption owing to sloughing of intestinal mucosa during iron deficiency, but this mechanism has not been definitively confirmed.<LK IDREF="R27-5">27</LK> Children have increased nutritional demands because they are in a growth phase. No patient in this study had any evidence of a disorder associated with malabsorption, such as regional enteritis. Malnutrition is frequent in chronic maintenance dialysis patients<LK IDREF="R21-5 R28-5 R29-5 R30-5 R31-5">21,28&ndash;31</LK> who, in addition to problems with absorption from the gastrointestinal tract, suffer considerable loss of essential nutrients, such as amino acids and vitamins, in the dialysate. On the basis of studies in nonuremic rats that have undergone intestinal resection and reanastomosis, it has recently been proposed that rhEPO exerts anabolic effects.<LK IDREF="R32-5">32</LK> However, such effects, even if they occur in humans, cannot explain the findings observed in our patients, because the patients who exhibited the increase in muscle mass received significantly less rhEPO.</P>
<P>That dialysis patients suffer from deficiency of iron stores is not surprising. The prevalence of iron deficiency in the present study closely approximates the reported rate of 50&percnt; in dialysis patients in the United States.<LK IDREF="R33-5">33</LK> The present study strongly suggests that effective iron repletion can lead not only to improvement in anemia but also to considerable improvement in nutrition and well being.</P>
<P>Serum albumin, an independent predictor of mortality,<LK IDREF="R34-5">34</LK> increased by 2.19 g&sol;L during intravenous iron administration, and by 4.00 g&sol;L in July through September 1997 &lpar;<E T="I">P</E>&lt;0.0001&rpar;, which suggested further improvement in well being. The reason for this striking increase is obscure. It seems reasonable to assume that increased well being that occurred with anemia correction may be associated with better appetite and, consequently, better nutrition. The decrease in blood pressure was unexpected, particularly as attention in literature has centered around the increased blood pressure observed when anemia of dialysis patients improves through rhEPO treatment.<LK IDREF="R35-5">35</LK> Improvement in anemia was greatest in patients with low MCV at the outset and was independent of initial serum ferritin level. Improvement in blood pressure, on the other hand, was greater in patients with lower serum ferritins, suggesting an association with iron repletion in patients with deficient iron stores. This differential improvement is not explained by a difference in the antihypertensive drugs prescribed. In the 2&hyphen;year period, 38&percnt; of the low&hyphen;ferritin and 18&percnt; of the high&hyphen;ferritin subset received no antihypertensives. When the amount received in the sixth and eighth trimesters was compared with that in the third trimester, 74.4&percnt; and 77.8&percnt; of those in the low&hyphen;ferritin subset and 59.4&percnt; and 69.7&percnt; of those in the high&hyphen;ferritin subset received the same or lower doses of antihypertensive drugs. The hypertension observed in dialysis patients on rhEPO has been attributed to both a hydrodynamic effect of the expansion of total blood volume that results from an increased red cell mass and from a postulated pressor effect of rhEPO.<LK IDREF="R36-5 R37-5">36,37</LK> For patients in the low&hyphen;ferritin subset, the reduction in blood pressure may be caused by decreased rhEPO use.</P>
<P>Observations reported herein illustrate the advantages of long&hyphen;term detailed follow&hyphen;up of patients treated by dialysis, in whom changes in well being manifest slowly. The changes in serum albumin, serum creatinine, and blood pressure became evident and statistically significant only 4&hyphen;6 months after intravenous iron treatment was started and were statistically significant after 6&hyphen;12 months. These are changes that have a favorable effect on morbidity and mortality,<LK IDREF="R34-5 R38-5">34,38</LK> and they were associated with an apparent decrease in morbidity and mortality in patients included in the present study.</P></LV2></LV1>

<LV1><HD><E T="B">INTRODUCTION</E></HD>
<P>In general, the methods used in gene transfection to mammalian cells are divided into two groups&colon; one uses a viral vector, and the other does not. Using a viral vector has some problems, namely, cell damage, emergence of a wild type of virus, and immunogenicity of repeated administration. The use of liposomes involves less toxicity for cells, but this technique transfects the gene vector to cells nonspecifically. In addition, the preparation of liposomes is a complex procedure. Electroporation is another method that involves making a hole in the cell membrane, but the targeted cell cannot be selected. Direct injection of a gene is an accurate method for transfecting targeted cells, but this method is technically difficult and it is hard to transfect cells floating in suspension.</P>
<P>Laser irradiation is a simple transfection method. Since the 1980s, the characteristics of laser beams have been investigated and several laser systems for cellular biotechnology have been developed.<LK IDREF="R1-6 R2-6 R3-6 R4-6 R5-6 R6-6 R7-6 R8-6">1&ndash;8</LK> With pulse laser irradiation, a small hole can be made in the cell membrane of a given cell. Through the hole a gene contained in the culture medium can be transferred into the cell, depending on the difference in osmotic pressure between the cytoplasm and the medium.<LK IDREF="R8-6">8</LK> The laser irradiation method is not affected by the receptor or interaction with the cell membrane. The laser method enables us to transfect genes, even if the number of cells is very small. Controlling the power of laser irradiation can reduce cell injury. There have been some reports that have described laser irradiation for gene transfection,<LK IDREF="R1-6 R2-6 R3-6 R4-6 R7-6 R8-6">1&ndash;4,7,8</LK> but there has been no such report in which the transfection efficiency was evaluated on the basis of the number of cells that express the transfected gene. In this study we developed a laser transfection system that uses two kinds of laser beams&colon; a pulse laser to make the hole in a cell membrane and a continuous laser to trap the cell. The gene was transfected by laser irradiation, and we obtained a high transfection efficiency, as demonstrated by the number of cells expressing the transfected gene. We also successfully transfected the gene into cells floating in suspension through the use of trapping and pulse laser. We believe that these techniques are very useful in cellular biotechnology for gene transfection to targeted cells.</P></LV1>
<LV1><HD><E T="B">MATERIALS AND METHODS</E></HD>
<LV2><HD>Laser Irradiation System</HD>
<P>Two kinds of laser beams were used. The pulse&hyphen;wave Nd&colon;YAG laser &lpar;RCR&hyphen;11, Quanta&hyphen;RAY, Mountain View, Calif&rpar; with a wavelength of 355 nm was used to make the hole in the cell membrane. The power of irradiation was controlled using a pulse generator &lpar;DG535, Stanford Research Systems, Sunnyvale, Calif&rpar;. To trap a cell, a continuous&hyphen;wave Nd&colon;YAG laser source &lpar;IRCL&hyphen;1W&hyphen;WL, diode&hyphen;pumped infrared CrystaLaser, CrystaLaser, Reno, Nev&rpar; with 0.5 W of output energy and a wavelength of 1015 nm was used. By shifting the stage of the microscope, the laser beam was collimated into the inverted microscope &lpar;Diaphoto, Nikon, Tokyo, Japan&rpar;, and the beam was focused on the target cell through an immersion objective lens &lpar;x100&rpar;. The power of the pulse beam was measured using a power meter &lpar;TQ8210, Advantest, Tokyo, Japan&rpar; through the objective lens.</P></LV2>
<LV2><HD>Cell Preparation</HD>
<P>The recipient cell lines used were HuH&hyphen;7, human, highly differentiated hepatocellular carcinoma cells, NIH&sol;3T3 mouse &lpar;BALB&sol;C&rpar; fibroblasts, and stimulatory protein 2 &lpar;SP2&rpar; mouse &lpar;BALB&sol;C&rpar; myeloma cells. HuH&hyphen;7 and SP2 cells were maintained in RPMI1640 &lpar;GIBCO&hyphen;BRL, Grand Island, NY&rpar; supplemented with 10&percnt; fetal bovine serum &lpar;FBS&rpar; &lpar;Sigma, St Louis, Mo&rpar; at 37&deg;C in 5&percnt; CO<SB>2</SB>. NIH&sol;3T3 cells were maintained in Dulbecco's Modified Eagle Medium, DMEM &lpar;GIBCO&hyphen;BRL&rpar; supplement with 10&percnt; FBS. After trypsinization, HuH&hyphen;7 and NIH&sol;3T3 cells suspended at a cell density of 5.0x10<SP>5</SP> cells&sol;mL were seeded 50 &mgr;L from the center of a glass&hyphen;bottom dish &lpar;Matsunami Glass, Osaka, Japan&rpar;. Two hours later, 1.5 mL of fresh medium was added to the dish. Cells were incubated for 36&hyphen;48 hours before laser irradiation. SP2 cells suspended in RPMI1640 without FBS at a cell density of 2.0x10<SP>5</SP> cells&sol;mL and appropriate amounts of plasmid were mixed to attain a final concentration of 10 &mgr;g plasmid&sol;mL. Then, 50 &mgr;L of this transfection medium was injected into the central portion of the glass dish.</P></LV2>
<LV2><HD>Gene Vector</HD>
<P>The pEGFP&hyphen;N1 vector &lpar;Clontech, Palo Alto, Calif&rpar; was used to transfect to HuH&hyphen;7 and NIH&sol;3T3 cells, whereas the pCl&hyphen;neo mammalian expression vector &lpar;Promega, Madison, Wis&rpar; was used to transfect SP2 cells. The pEGFP&hyphen;N1 vector is a plasmid that carries the gene that encodes the EGFP under the control of a cytomegalovirus promoter. The excitation of EGFP was 488 nm, and the emission was 508 nm&semi; its fluorescent expression was detected under an inverted fluorescence microscope with the filter sets for fluorescein isothiocyanate &lpar;FITC&rpar; optics. The region of the SV40 promoter and neomycin&hyphen;resistance genes existed downstream from the EGFP gene. The pCl&hyphen;neo mammalian expression vector is a plasmid that caries the gene that encodes neomycin phosphotransferase under the control of SV40 promoter. Neomycin phosphotransferase inactivates neomycin.</P></LV2>
<LV2><HD>Procedure of Laser Transfection and Detection of Gene Expression of EGFP</HD>
<P>After rinsing the dish with phosphorated buffered saline solution, 50 &mgr;L of the transfection medium &lpar;RPMI1640 without FBS&rpar; containing a pEGFP&hyphen;N1 vector at a concentration of 20 &mgr;g&sol;mL was injected at the center portion of the dish. The pulse laser irradiated 100 cells each of the HuH&hyphen;7 and NIH&sol;3T3 live cells. The center of each cell was the focus of irradiation. Damaged cells, which were swollen or destroyed, were excluded. After laser irradiation the medium was aspirated, the dish was washed with phosphorated buffered saline solution, and 1.5 mL of the fresh medium containing FBS was added. We prepared two groups&colon; &lpar;i&rpar; the irradiated and &lpar;ii&rpar; the nonirradiated group. In both groups plasmids were contained in the medium. Every 24 hours the cells were examined for the expression of EGFP under a fluorescence microscope and the fluorescent cells were counted. Transfection efficiency &lpar;N&rpar; was calculated according to the following formula&colon;</P>
<P>N&equals;number of cells expressing EGFP&sol;number of irradiated cells x100&percnt;</P>
<P>On day 5 after transfection, the cells were trypsinized, reseeded in a six&hyphen;well plate, and cultured in selection medium that contained G418 &lpar;Promega&rpar; at a concentration of 250 &mgr;g&sol;mL. The expression of EGFP and cell proliferation were investigated &lpar;n&equals;5&rpar;.</P></LV2>
<LV2><HD>Relationship Between Concentration of Plasmid and Transfection Efficiency</HD>
<P>The transfection medium that contained plasmids at various concentrations was injected into the dish and 100 cells of the HuH&hyphen;7 cell line were irradiated following the same procedure described above. The concentration levels of pEGFP&hyphen;N1 varied among 0.0, 2.5, 5.0, 10.0, 20.0, and 40.0 &mgr;g&sol;mL. After 24 hours the cells that expressed EGFP were counted and the transfection efficiency was determined &lpar;n&equals;5&rpar;.</P></LV2>
<LV2><HD>Transfection by Laser to Floating Cells and Detection of Gene Expression</HD>
<P>Fifty microliters of the transfection medium was injected into the dish. The targeted cell was fixed by irradiation of the trapping laser, and the cell was then irradiated by the pulse laser. One hundred cells were irradiated. The foci of the trapping and pulse lasers were placed at the centers of the cells. Cells damaged after irradiation were excluded. After irradiation, 1.5 mL of the selection medium RPMI1640 with FBS, which contained G418 at the concentration of 250 &mgr;g&sol;mL, was immediately added to the dish. The selection medium was changed every 3 days. We prepared three groups as follows&colon; &lpar;i&rpar; the control group, treated with neither plasmid nor irradiation, &lpar;ii&rpar; the irradiated group, and &lpar;iii&rpar; the nonirradiated group that contained plasmid at the same concentration as the medium without irradiation. The proliferating cells were investigated and surviving cells were counted 2 weeks later &lpar;n&equals;5&rpar;.</P></LV2>
<LV2><HD>Statistics</HD>
<P>The data were analyzed by Student's <E T="I">t</E> test with the application of Stat View 5.0 &lpar;SAS Institute, Inc, Cary, NC&rpar;. A value of <E T="I">P</E> &lt;0.05 was considered statistically significant for this study.</P></LV2></LV1>
<LV1><HD><E T="B">RESULTS</E></HD>
<LV2><HD>Procedure of Gene Transfer by Laser</HD>
<P>We developed a transfection system that uses two laser beams. A schema of the system is shown in <LK IDREF="F1-6">Figure 1</LK>. Laser beams that were irradiated from two laser sources, one for trapping and the other for pulsation, were deflected by mirrors and led into the inverted microscope. Targeted cells on the cover glass placed at the center of the dish were irradiated through a x100 objective lens for oil immersion. This procedure was monitored using a CCD camera. We selected the targeted cell for irradiation by moving the stage of the microscope. The power of pulse laser was controlled using a power generator. The process for making a hole in the cell membrane of an SP2 cell by laser irradiation is shown in <LK IDREF="F2-6">Figure 2</LK>. The hole was recognized as a dark area at the site of laser irradiation, and its diameter was &ap;2 &mgr;m. The hole made with appropriate irradiation disappeared immediately with no cell damage being observed. The duration of pulse irradiation was &ap;10 nanoseconds, and the most suitable power of pulse laser irradiation was from 0.91 to 1.10 &mgr;J&sol;pulse. In damaged cells with unsuitable irradiation, cell swelling, destruction of cell membrane, and rupture of cytoplasm were observed. The success rate of pulse laser irradiation in making holes was &ap;60&percnt; in the case of live HuH&hyphen;7 and NIH&sol;3T3 cells, which formed a monolayer. On the other hand, the rate of &ap;10&percnt; for cells growing as suspension cultures without fixation was very low, because the cells easily changed position and the lasers could not be focused on the sites of irradiation. In our laser irradiation system we could move and&sol;or fix the cells as we liked with a trapping laser. With fixation by laser irradiation, the success rate improved to 60&percnt; in the case of SP2 cells.</P>

<LV1><HD><E T="B">DISCUSSION</E></HD>
<P>The use of laser beams in biotechnology began to develop in the 1980s.<LK IDREF="R1-6 R2-6 R3-6 R4-6 R5-6 R6-6 R7-6 R8-6">1&ndash;8</LK> The key characteristic of the system we have developed is that the operator can select a single target cell and manipulate it according to the purpose of study in question. Theoretically, by using laser irradiation, one can insert plasmids into a cell without harmful or specific vectors, such as viral vectors or cationic liposomes. Kurata et al<LK IDREF="R1-6">1</LK> reported that the plasmid that encodes xanthine&hyphen;guanine phosphoribosyltransferase was transfected to mammalian cells using laser irradiation, and the proliferation of cells was recognized in a medium that contained mycophenolic acid. Palumbo et al<LK IDREF="R8-6">8</LK> transfected reporter genes such as CAT or LacZ to NIH&sol;3T3 cells through the use of laser irradiation and verified gene expression. Yet, up to now there have been no studies that have examined transfection efficiency on the basis of the number of cells that expressed the transfected gene. In the present study, we transfected plasmid that encodes the EGFP gene to cells, then we investigated the expression of that gene and the proliferation of the transfected cells. We counted the cells that expressed EGFP and determined the transfection efficiency. We also established transformed cell lives. In addition to pulse laser, we transfected a plasmid that encodes the neomycin&hyphen;resistance gene to floating cells by using a trapping laser. This is the first study in which transfection by laser irradiation was used to transfect cells in suspension culture as well as cells growing as a monolayer. Our newly developed method is simpler in comparison with the direct injection method, which cannot be used to transfect floating cells growing in suspension. Compared with electroporation, targeted cells can be selected in the laser method, and gene transfection can be carried out even if the number of cells is small.</P>
<P>Generally, the negatively charged cell surface and plasmid repel each other. The negative charge of cell surface abates when a hole is made by laser irradiation, and plasmids can approach the cell surface. Plasmids are likely transferred through the hole via a difference in osmotic pressure between cytoplasm and medium from medium to cytoplasm because the osmotic pressure of cytoplasm is higher than that of the medium. In our study, we demonstrated that &ap;1.00 &mgr;J&sol;pulse was a suitable power for irradiation by pulse laser. The energy of the irradiated laser beam is absorbed by the cell membrane, and it makes a hole in 1 second. Laser energy is converted into thermal energy in the cell membrane, and membrane mobility changes.<LK IDREF="R1-6 R8-6">1,8</LK> Appropriate irradiation does not cause damage such as irreversible cell swelling or destruction of the cell membrane.<LK IDREF="R1-6 R8-6">1,8</LK> The power adjustment of the pulse laser was very delicate and, because the fragility of target cells differed, its use required a fine degree of control on each cell. We controlled the power of laser irradiation and were able to reduce cell injury. We also investigated the suitable concentration of plasmid in the medium for laser transfection&semi; a concentration of 10.0&hyphen;20.0 &mgr;g&sol;mL resulted in a transfection efficiency of &ap;10&percnt;. At a concentration of less than 10 &mgr;g&sol;mL, the rate of transfection was very low because plasmids were scarcely transferred into the cell.</P>
<P>In gene transfection, a plasmid is introduced into the cytosol by endocytosis and is digested by lysosomes.<LK IDREF="R9-6 R10-6">9,10</LK> In the transfection method that uses liposomes, the plasmid is introduced into almost all cells nonspecifically, yet the transfection efficacy of the gene vector to the nucleus is low.<LK IDREF="R9-6 R10-6">9,10</LK> Neves et al<LK IDREF="R11-6 R12-6 R13-6">11&ndash;13</LK> reported that coupling of nuclear localization signals &lpar;NLS&rpar; to plasmids improved the nuclear import of gene vectors and the rate of gene expression increased. By using our method it is possible to transfer various substances, such as NLS, into the medium. The rate of expression of a gene can be improved when plasmids are transferred along with the NLS to the medium, as in the laser transfection method.</P>
<P>Kurata et al<LK IDREF="R1-6">1</LK> investigated the transfection efficiency of laser transfection using the proliferating factor&semi; the transfection rate ranged from 0.6 to 10.0&percnt;. In our study, we were able to transfect EGFP&hyphen;genes into human hepatocellular carcinoma cells and mouse fibroblast cells, and we evaluated the transfection efficiency by directly counting the cells that expressed EGFP. The efficiency rate was 10.0&percnt;, which was considered to be high. Besides making effective use of the trapping laser, we were also able to transfect the gene to cells floating in suspension. These results indicated that our laser system was superior to previously described methods in the sense that transfection to both attached cells and cells in suspension was attained with high transfection rates.</P>
<P>In conclusion, our newly developed transfection method that uses laser beams has various advantages. We can select the target cells into which we want to transfect a gene vector according to the shapes of the cells. This method is simple and does not require introduction of harmful or specific substances, such as viral vectors or liposomes. Use of the trapping laser enables us to transfer plasmids to cells in suspension, such as lymphocytes or myelocytes, as well as to attached cells, and we can attain a high transfection rate. Considering these advantages, our system will prove very useful in clinical biotechnology, being applicable in gene therapy for cancer patients,<LK IDREF="R14-6 R15-6">14,15</LK> for diseases caused by enzyme deficiency,<LK IDREF="R16-6 R17-6 R18-6">16&ndash;18</LK> or for chemoresistance of anticancer drugs through a multidrug&hyphen;resistance gene in hematopoietic cells.<LK IDREF="R19-6 R20-6">19,20</LK></P></LV1></BD>

<LV1><HD><E T="B">INTRODUCTION</E></HD>
<P>11&bgr;&hyphen;Hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase type 2 is a nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide&hyphen;dependent, unidirectional enzyme, which catalyzes the conversion of the glucocorticoid hormones cortisol and corticosterone &lpar;B&rpar; into their corresponding inactive forms, cortisone and DH&hyphen;B.<LK IDREF="R1-7">1</LK> 11&bgr;&hyphen;HSD2 is highly expressed in liver and kidneys, and it plays a pivotal role in controlling the access of glucocorticoids to their intracellular receptors, thereby protecting the nonselective mineralocorticoid receptors from glucocorticoid excess.<LK IDREF="R2-7">2</LK></P>
<P>Although some studies failed to detect 11&bgr;&hyphen;HSD2 mRNA in human adrenals by Western blotting,<LK IDREF="R3-7 R4-7 R5-7">3&ndash;5</LK> we were able to demonstrate the expression of the 11&bgr;&hyphen;HSD2 gene in dispersed human adrenocortical cells with RT&hyphen;PCR.<LK IDREF="R6-7">6</LK> Moreover, we showed a significant degree of 11&bgr;&hyphen;HSD2 activity in human adrenal, as well as the existence of a net positive gradient of cortisone and DH&hyphen;B across the adrenal vascular bed, through the use of adrenal vein sampling in both patients with primary aldosteronism and those undergoing nephrectomy with ipsilateral adrenalectomy for kidney cancer.<LK IDREF="R6-7 R7-7">6,7</LK> We also provided evidence that 11&bgr;&hyphen;HSD2 activity is negatively modulated by the intra&hyphen;adrenal concentration of non&hyphen;11&bgr;&hyphen;hydroxylated steroid hormones.<LK IDREF="R6-7">6</LK> In light of these findings, it seemed worthwhile to investigate the gene expression of 11&bgr;&hyphen;HSD2 in cortisol&hyphen;secreting adrenal adenomas and to compare the activity of this enzyme in vitro in adenomas and in the normal human adrenal cortex.</P></LV1>
<LV1><HD><E T="B">METHODS</E></HD>
<P>Three adult patients with unilateral cortisol&hyphen;secreting adrenal adenomas that had produced Cushing syndrome were recruited. They displayed high basal levels of plasma and urinary 17&hyphen;hydroxysteroids and 17&hyphen;ketosteroids as well as low levels &lpar;&lt;8 pg&sol;mL&rpar; of plasma ACTH. After adrenal mass identification by nuclear magnetic resonance, the patients underwent surgery, and the resected tumors were well encapsulated and measured 3.2x3.5x3.8, 2.1x2.5x3.3, and 1.9x2.3x2.0 cm, respectively. The three were histologically identified as lipid&hyphen;rich &lpar;presumably zona fasciculata&rpar; cell, benign adrenocortical adenomas. Normal adrenal glands were obtained from three patients who underwent unilateral nephrectomy with ipsilateral adrenalectomy for renal cancer. Fragments of adenomas and adrenal tails, which do not contain adrenal medulla,<LK IDREF="R8-7">8</LK> were collected immediately after excision in the operating room, placed in Krebs&hyphen;Ringer bicarbonate buffer with 2&percnt; glucose at 4&deg;C, and immediately carried to the cell biology laboratory. The study protocol was approved by the local Ethics Committee for Human Studies.</P>
<P>RNA was extracted from adenoma and normal adrenal tissues with the guanidium isothiocyanate method, and the RT&hyphen;PCR procedures were those detailed in an earlier study.<LK IDREF="R6-7">6</LK> The following 11&bgr;&hyphen;HSD2&hyphen;specific primers were used&colon; &lpar;i&rpar; sense HSD11&hyphen;ACG CAG GCC ACA ATG AAG TAG&hyphen;3&prime; and &lpar;ii&rpar; two antisense HSD11&hyphen;5&prime;&hyphen;GCT CAC GGA GCC TCC TGT GC&hyphen;3&prime; and HSD11&hyphen;1382&hyphen;5&prime;&hyphen;GCT CAC GGA GCC TCC TGT GC&hyphen;3&prime;, both of which are expected to provide polymerase chain reaction &lpar;PCR&rpar; products of 295 and 769 base pair &lpar;bp&rpar;, respectively. To rule out the possibility of amplifying genomic DNA, in some experiments the PCR was performed with no prior reverse transcription &lpar;RT&rpar; of the RNA. Detection of the PCR amplification products was carried out by size fractionation on 2&percnt;&hyphen;agarose gel electrophoresis. For quantitation purpose, 35 cycles were used &lpar;94&deg;C for 60 seconds, 60&deg;C for 60 seconds, and 72&deg;C for 60 seconds&rpar;&semi; under these conditions the yield of products was proportional to the RNA template.</P>
<P>Slices from the three adenomas and adrenal cortices were put in medium 199 &lpar;Difco, Detroit, Mich&rpar; and Krebs&hyphen;Ringer bicarbonate buffer with 2&percnt; glucose that contained 5 mg&sol;mL bovine serum albumin. They were incubated &lpar;4&hyphen;5 mg&sol;mL, in replicates of three of each specimen&rpar; in the presence or absence of 10<SP>&hyphen;9</SP> mol&sol;L ACTH &lpar;Peninsula Laboratories, St Helens, United Kingdom&rpar;. The incubation was carried out in a shaking bath at 37&deg;C for 60 minutes in an atmosphere of 95&percnt; air&hyphen;5&percnt; CO<SB>2</SB>. Steroid hormones were extracted from the incubation media, and the concentrations of cortisol, B, cortisone, and DH&hyphen;B were measured by quantitative HPLC, as previously detailed.<LK IDREF="R6-7">6</LK> The protein concentration of the incubated tissue fragments was determined by the Lowry method, which used bovine serum albumin as a standard, and steroid production was expressed as pmol&sol;mg protein. Other slices from the three adenomas and adrenal cortices were incubated, as described above, with 370 kBq&sol;kg of &lsqb;1,2,6,7 <SP>3</SP>H&rsqb;&hyphen;cortisol &lpar;SA, 1.85&hyphen;3.33 TBq&sol;mmol&semi; Amersham Laboratories, Aylesbury, United Kingdom&rpar; in the presence or absence of 10<SP>&hyphen;9</SP> mol&sol;L ACTH. Cortisone was extracted from the incubation media, purified by HPLC, transferred into scintillation vials, and counted in a Beckman Coulter liquid scintillation counter. &lsqb;<SP>3</SP>H&rsqb;&hyphen;cortisone formed was expressed as cpm&sol;mg protein.</P>
<P>Data obtained from each adenoma and adrenal cortex &lpar;three samples for each experimental point&rpar; were averaged and expressed as means&plusmn;SEM of three separate experiments &lpar;three different adenomas and three different adrenal cortices&rpar;. The statistical comparison was performed by ANOVA, followed by Duncan's multiple&hyphen;range test.</P></LV1>

<P>The RT&hyphen;PCR allowed the detection of the 11&bgr;&hyphen;HSD2 mRNA in the three adrenal adenomas and adrenal cortices examined.

<LV1><HD><E T="B">DISCUSSION</E></HD>
<P>The present study allowed us to identify by RT&hyphen;PCR 11&bgr;&hyphen;HSD2 expression in cortisol&hyphen;secreting adenomas and adrenal cortices. With the use of specific primers we have been able to amplify the cDNA of the 11&bgr;&hyphen;HSD2 gene after RT from total RNA by random&hyphen;hexamer methods. Indeed, this approach has consistently allowed amplification of cDNA fragments of expected size for the gene in all adenomas examined. Densitometric evaluation did not reveal significant differences in the 11&bgr;&hyphen;HSD2 gene expression between adenomas and normal cortices &lpar;data not shown&rpar;.</P>
<P>The presence of 11&bgr;&hyphen;HSD2 mRNA has previously been found in aldosterone&hyphen;secreting adenomas and carcinomas.<LK IDREF="R4-7 R5-7">4,5</LK> Although these studies did not evaluate 11&bgr;&hyphen;HSD2 activity, 11&bgr;&hyphen;HSD2 expression has been interpreted as indicating the involvement of this enzyme in counteracting abnormally elevated steroidogenesis. On the other hand, our recent observation that a series of 10 Conn's adenomas did not release detectable amounts of cortisone and DH&hyphen;B in vitro appears to conflict with the above contention.<LK IDREF="R9-7">9</LK> Accordingly, our present study strongly suggests that 11&bgr;&hyphen;HSD2 activity is suppressed in cortisol&hyphen;secreting adenomas, as compared with normal adrenals. In fact, basal production per unit weight of both cortisone and DH&hyphen;B is &ap;50&percnt; less in adenomas than in adrenal tissue, and the adenoma capacity to convert &lsqb;<SP>3</SP>H&rsqb;&hyphen;cortisol to &lsqb;<SP>3</SP>H&rsqb;&hyphen;cortisone is &ap;35&percnt; of that of normal adrenal tissue.</P>
<P>Rat adrenal cortex expresses the 11&bgr;&hyphen;HSD2 gene and maintains 11&bgr;&hyphen;HSD2 activity,<LK IDREF="R10-7">10</LK> and it has been demonstrated that ACTH, although raising corticosterone production in vitro, markedly lowers DH&hyphen;B output.<LK IDREF="R11-7 R12-7">11,12</LK> We recently obtained similar results in the human adrenal cortex, where the conversion of cortisol to cortisone is suppressed not only by ACTH, but also by the other glucocorticoid agonist, angiotensin&hyphen;II. Both agonists fail to affect microsomal 11&bgr;&hyphen;HSD2 activity in vitro, and their suppressive effects on cortisone production are counteracted by inhibitors of the early steps of steroid synthesis.<LK IDREF="R6-7">6</LK> On these grounds it has been suggested that the effect of ACTH and angiotensin&hyphen;II on cortisone secretion may be produced by the intracellular rise in non&hyphen;11&bgr;&hyphen;hydroxylated substrates, which results in saturation of 11&bgr;&hyphen;HSD2. Owing to the paucity of adrenal adenoma tissue available, we were not able to repeat all the experiments carried out previously with human adrenocortical tissue&semi; however, the present results which show that ACTH strongly lowers the cortisone and DH&hyphen;B yield of adenoma slices are in keeping with this view. In conclusion, our findings appear to be consistent with the possibility that the high intracellular concentration of steroid&hyphen;hormone intermediates that occur in cortisol&hyphen;secreting adenomas may down&hyphen;regulate 11&bgr;&hyphen;HSD2 activity, thereby contributing to the abnormally elevated glucocorticoid secretion of these tumors.</P>
<P>Human adrenal cortex is also known to express 11&bgr;&hyphen;HSD1, a nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate&hyphen;dependent bidirectional enzyme that preferentially transforms cortisone and DH&hyphen;B into cortisol and B.<LK IDREF="R1-7">1</LK> Hence, our study does not rule out the possibility that in cortisol&hyphen;secreting adenomas up&hyphen;regulation of 11&bgr;&hyphen;HSD1 may coincide with their low rate of cortisone and DH&hyphen;B release. Although it has been reported that in some cases of adrenal hyperplasia 11&bgr;&hyphen;HSD1 activity is suppressed rather than up&hyphen;regulated,<LK IDREF="R13-7">13</LK> this possibility merits exploration.</P></LV1></BD>

<LV1><HD><E T="B">INTRODUCTION</E></HD>
<P>The chronic fatigue syndrome is a disease of unknown etiology with severe disabling fatigue that lasts longer than 6 months.<LK IDREF="R1-8 R2-8">1,2</LK> Several causes have been investigated for this syndrome, including an impaired functioning of the immune response, chronic viral infections, and endocrinological disturbances.<LK IDREF="R3-8 R4-8">3,4</LK> Several reports have shown that CFS patients display an altered functioning of the immune response&semi; ie, altered cytokine production, low NK&hyphen;cell function, and differences in the expression of activation markers on lymphocytes.<LK IDREF="R5-8 R6-8 R7-8 R8-8 R9-8 R10-8 R11-8 R12-8 R13-8 R14-8 R15-8 R16-8 R17-8">5&ndash;17</LK> Others have suggested that an antiviral pathway in CFS patients is upregulated as the consequence of an increased viral load or viral reactivation in CFS patients<LK IDREF="R18-8 R19-8">18,19</LK>&semi; however, until now no infectious agent could be linked to the syndrome. Furthermore, the observed immunological disturbances show a great diversity of results. Most of this diversity can be explained by the heterogeneity of the patient population and the read&hyphen;out systems that have been used.<LK IDREF="R13-8">13</LK> Endocrinological studies performed by several groups have demonstrated impaired functioning of the hypothalamus pituitary adrenal gland &lpar;HPA&rpar; axis in CFS patients.<LK IDREF="R20-8 R21-8 R22-8">20&ndash;22</LK> CFS patients showed significantly reduced levels of urinary free&hyphen;cortisol and reduced production of adrenocorticotropic hormone &lpar;ACTH&rpar; upon stimulation with corticotropin releasing hormone &lpar;CRH&rpar;. Furthermore, a blunted response to ACTH in cortisol production has been shown.<LK IDREF="R20-8 R21-8 R22-8">20&ndash;22</LK> These alterations in levels of substances are quite different when compared with depression, which is characterized by a hyperfunctioning of the HPA axis, which results in high levels of cortisol.<LK IDREF="R23-8 R24-8">23,24</LK> Also, most patients with depression show reduced dexamethasone &lpar;DEX&rpar; suppression, probably because of a reduced functioning of the GR.<LK IDREF="R23-8 R24-8">23,24</LK></P>
<P>In patients with fibromyalgia, a slight impairment of the GR has been demonstrated. Although, these patients showed reduced affinity of the GR, they had normal responses to GC in vitro.<LK IDREF="R25-8">25</LK></P>
<P>We have previously demonstrated an altered reactivity to GC in CFS patients, as evidenced by the increased suppression by DEX of proliferation and IL&hyphen;4 production of CD4&hyphen;positive T cells.<LK IDREF="R17-8">17</LK> Moreover, immunological responses in CFS are not related with endogenous cortisol &lpar;Visser et al, unpublished data, 2001&rpar;.<LK IDREF="R26-8">26</LK> Furthermore, hydrocortisone &lpar;HC&rpar; replacement therapy in CFS gave some improvement, but this also lead to adrenal insufficiency.<LK IDREF="R27-8">27</LK> Taken together evidence is emerging that the GR function is altered in CFS patients.</P>
<P>To investigate this possibility, we studied the affinity and distribution of the GR in peripheral blood mononuclear cells &lpar;PBMC&rpar; of 10 CFS patients and 14 matched controls. In addition, RT&hyphen;PCR was used to investigate the messenger RNA &lpar;mRNA&rpar; expression of the GR and heat shock protein 90 &lpar;HSP90&rpar;. PBMC were also studied with regard to their sensitivity to DEX and HC in vitro during mitogen&hyphen;induced proliferation and cytokine production.</P></LV1>
<LV1><HD><E T="B">MATERIALS AND METHODS</E></HD>
<LV2><HD>Subjects</HD>
<LV3><HD>Selection Criteria</HD>
<P>We included patients between 18 and 50 years of age who met the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention criteria as defined by Fukuda et al.<LK IDREF="R2-8">2</LK> Patients suffering from somatic and psychiatric disorders and patients using beta&hyphen;blockers, psychotropic drugs, immunosuppressive drugs, or diuretics were excluded from the study. Furthermore, patients with an alcohol intake of more than four units of alcohol per day and a body mass index of greater than 45 were excluded from the study.</P></LV3>
<LV3><HD>Recruitment of Patients and Controls</HD>
<P>Patients were recruited by 38 general practitioners who were associated with the Department of General Practice and Nursing Home Medicine, Leiden University Medical Center. We verified, by inspection of the medical records, whether the prospective patients met the criteria defined above. The general practitioners contacted a total of 66 patients to participate in the study. From these 66 patients, 59 gave their informed consent. It turned out that these patients had been examined extensively by their general practitioner and&sol;or specialist. In light of this circumstance, we did not apply extra diagnostic tests.</P>
<P>Each patient was requested to recruit a healthy control matched for age, race, and sex from the patient's direct environment. The controls had to be nonfatigued, healthy persons &lpar;friends, neighbors, and colleagues&rpar;. None of these controls was from the same households as the patients. Thirty&hyphen;nine patients found such controls. Seventeen controls were selected by the general practitioners from the same practice as the patients and matched by race, sex, and age. Informed consent was obtained from all the controls. All the controls got a questionnaire about their current histories of fatigue and whether they had ever had chronic diseases. It turned out that one control used a &bgr;&hyphen;blocker and another control had a current history of fatigue. These two controls were excluded from the analysis.</P>
<P>The mean age of the CFS group was 38&plusmn;8 years&semi; and the mean age of the control group was 38&plusmn;9 years. The female&hyphen;to&hyphen;male ratio in both groups was 2&colon;1.</P>
<P>Fasting blood samples of each patient and the corresponding control were obtained simultaneously at the patients' homes between 7&colon;00 and 10&colon;00 am. This study was approved by the Medical Ethics Committee of the Leiden University Medical Center.</P></LV3></LV2>
<LV2><HD>Isolation of Cells</HD>
<P>PBMC were isolated from EDTA blood by Ficoll &lpar;Sigma Chemical Co, St Louis, Mo&rpar; density centrifugation. The cells were cryopreserved and thawed according to standard procedures to enable batchwise analysis of patients and controls at a later time.</P></LV2>
<LV2><HD>Cell Cultures</HD>
<P>Cultures of PBMC were performed in Iscoves Modified Dulbecco's Medium &lpar;Gibco, Paisley, United Kingdom&rpar; supplemented with 10&percnt; fetal calf serum &lpar;Sebak Gmbh, Aidenbach, Germany&rpar;, 100 U&sol;mL penicillin, 100 &mgr;g&sol;mL streptomycin, and 50 &mgr;mol&sol;L &bgr;&hyphen;mercaptoethanol. Cells were cultured at a density of 40,000 cells&sol;well in a volume of 200 &mgr;L in flat&hyphen;bottomed 96&hyphen;well microtiter plates &lpar;Costar, Cambridge, Mass&rpar; and stimulated with 0.5 or 1 &mgr;g&sol;mL phytohemagglutinin &lpar;PHA&semi; Murex, Dartford, United Kingdom&rpar;. DEX or HC was added to obtain a final concentration of 10<SP>&hyphen;6</SP>, 10<SP>&hyphen;7</SP> or 10<SP>&hyphen;8</SP> mol. Finally, phorbol 12&hyphen;myristate 13&hyphen;acetate &lpar;PMA&rpar; was added to the cultures in a concentration ranging from 0.1 to 0.3 ng&sol;mL. Supernatants of PBMC cultures were harvested on day 4 and proliferation was measured on day 5 by adding 18.5 KBq &lpar;0.5 &mgr;Ci&rpar; methyl&hyphen;&lsqb;<SP>3</SP> H&rsqb;&hyphen;thymidine &lpar;specific activity&colon; 74 GBq&sol;mmol&semi; Radiochemical Centre, Amersham, United Kingdom&rpar; during the last 6 hours of culture. The culture conditions described above and the points in time at which to measure cytokines and proliferation had been previously established with the intention of representing suboptimal conditions for cryopreserved cells in order to allow detection of the stimulatory and inhibitory effects of PMA, DEX, and HC. Supernatants were stored at &hyphen;20&deg;C until assay. Labeled cells were harvested onto glass fiber filters and the filters were counted using a Matrix 96 &bgr;&hyphen;counter &lpar;Canberra Packard, Meriden, Conn&rpar;.</P></LV2>
<LV2><HD>Cytokine Assays</HD>
<P>Cytokines were determined by enzyme&hyphen;linked immunosorbent assay &lpar;ELISA&rpar;, as described elsewhere.<LK IDREF="R17-8">17</LK> For the IFN&hyphen;&ggr; and IL&hyphen;2 detection, commercially available detection kits were used &lpar;BioSource, Fleurus, Belgium&rpar;. For the measurement of IL&hyphen;4, mouse&hyphen;anti&hyphen;human&hyphen;IL&hyphen;4 &lpar;clone 8D4&hyphen;8, 1 &mgr;g&sol;mL&rpar; was used as a capture antibody&semi; biotinylated rat&hyphen;anti&hyphen;human IL&hyphen;4 &lpar;clone MP4&hyphen;25D2, 2 &mgr;g&sol;mL&rpar; was used as a detecting antibody&semi; whereas human recombinant IL&hyphen;4 &lpar;standard curve ranged from 5000 to 2.5 pg&sol;mL&rpar; served as a standard &lpar;these reagents were purchased from Pharmingen, San Diego, Calif&rpar;.</P>
<P>For the detection of IL&hyphen;10 the plates were coated with JES3&hyphen;9D7 monoclonal antibody &lpar;Mab&rpar; &lpar;0.5 &mgr;g&sol;mL&rpar; and biotinylated JES3&hyphen;12G8 Mab was used in a concentration of 2 &mgr;g&sol;mL. Recombinant human IL&hyphen;10 &lpar;kindly provided by Dr S. Narula, Schering&hyphen;Plough Research Institute, Kenilworth, NJ&rpar; that was diluted in culture medium was used as a standard. The standard curves ranged from 2500 pg&sol;mL to 10 pg&sol;mL.</P>
<P>For the TNF&hyphen;&agr; ELISA, the plates were coated with 1 &mgr;g&sol;mL Mab1&semi; biotinylated Mab11 was used in a concentration of 1 &mgr;g&sol;mL for detection. Recombinant TNF&hyphen;&agr; that was diluted in culture medium was used as a standard. The standard curves ranged from 10,000 to 40 pg&sol;mL. All these reagents were purchased from Pharmingen.</P></LV2>
<LV2><HD>Hormone Detection</HD>
<P>Blood from the patients and the controls was collected, immediately put on ice, and allowed to coagulate. The tubes were centrifuged for 30 minutes &lpar;3000 rpm, 4&deg;C&rpar;&semi; serum was collected and immediately stored at &hyphen;20&deg;C. Serum total cortisol was measured using the fluorescent polarization immunoassay on the TDx &lpar;Abbott, Amstelveen, the Netherlands&rpar;. Serum levels of free cortisol were determined in the filtrate that was obtained by temperature&hyphen;controlled ultrafiltration with the Amicon MPS&hyphen;1 ultrafiltration device &lpar;Amicon, Inc, Beverly, Mass&rpar;. Cortisol binding globulin &lpar;CBG&rpar; concentrations were determined by radioimmunoassay &lpar;Medgenix Diagnostics, Fleurus, Belgium&rpar; according to the technique of Lentjes et al.<LK IDREF="R25-8">25</LK> ACTH was measured in EDTA&hyphen;plasma as described previously.<LK IDREF="R28-8">28</LK> No ACTH was measured in four patients and controls&semi; no total and free cortisol was measured in four patients&semi; and because of shortage of serum and plasma, no CBG was measured in 24 patients and 20 controls.</P></LV2>
<LV2><HD>Glucocorticoid Receptor Assay</HD>
<P>The number and affinity of the GR in PBMC of the patients and matched controls was determined using the technique described by Lentjes et al.<LK IDREF="R25-8">25</LK> PBMC were washed twice with phosphate buffered saline &lpar;NPBI, Emmercompascum, the Netherlands&rpar; and resuspended in RPMI 1640 &lpar;Gibco&rpar; medium, supplemented with 2 mmol&sol;L glutamine, 100 U&sol;mL penicillin, 100 &mgr;g&sol;mL streptomycin, and 10&percnt; FCS &lpar;Sebak&rpar;. This medium is further designated as RPMI&sol;FCS. The cells were preincubated for 1 hour at 37&deg;C and washed three times, and then the cells were incubated for 1 hour at 37&deg;C in a shaking waterbath with step&hyphen;fold diluted &lpar;range, 2.5&hyphen;60 nmol&sol;L&rpar; &lsqb;<SP>3</SP>H&rsqb;&hyphen;DEX &lpar;Amersham&rpar;. Nonspecific binding was measured in the presence of a 1000&hyphen;fold excess of unlabeled DEX. The incubations were terminated by adding 2 mL ice&hyphen;cold RPMI&sol;FCS. Cell&hyphen;bound DEX was separated from free DEX by washing the cells twice with ice&hyphen;cold RPMI&sol;FCS, followed by centrifugation &lpar;2.5 minutes at 12,000g&rpar; of the cells through a Ficoll&sol;PBS layer &lpar;density, 1.030 g&sol;mL&rpar;. The tube contents were frozen in CO<SB>2</SB>&hyphen;acetone, and the bottoms of the tubes, which contain the cell pellet, were cut off and transferred into 10&hyphen;mL liquid scintillation cocktails. The amount of &lsqb;<SP>3</SP>H&rsqb;&hyphen;DEX was determined with a &bgr;&hyphen;counter. The number of binding sites per cell and the Kd were calculated from a Woolf plot following Keightley et al.<LK IDREF="R29-8">29</LK></P></LV2>
<LV2><HD>RNA Quantitation of HSP90 and GR&agr; Using Semi&hyphen;Quantitative PCR</HD>
<P>Messenger RNA was extracted from the PBMC and used to measure HSP90 and GR&agr; mRNA in a semiquantitative manner, as described previously.<LK IDREF="R30-8 R31-8">30,31</LK> PCR products were separated on 1&percnt;&hyphen;agarose gels and stained with ethidium bromide or SYBR Green I &lpar;Biozym, Landgraaf, the Netherlands&rpar;. Densities of the amplified cDNA were analyzed using the Bio&hyphen;1D digital imaging system version 6 &lpar;Vilber Lourmat, Marne La Vall&eacute;e, France&rpar;. Results are expressed as a ratio of quantified HSP90 and GR&agr; product over &bgr;&hyphen;actin product.</P>

<LV1><HD><E T="B">RESULTS</E></HD>
<LV2><HD>ACTH and Cortisol Levels in CFS Patients and Matched Controls</HD>
<P>In the group of 59 carefully selected CFS patients and 56 healthy controls, the levels of total and free cortisol, ACTH, and CBG were measured. In both groups the users of contraceptives &lpar;N&equals;20&rpar; were excluded from the analysis. As shown in <LK IDREF="T1-8">Table 1</LK> no differences were found in the measured levels of the hormones or CBG between patients and controls.</P>
<TB ID="T1-8"><TI><E T="BIT">Table 1 Cortisol, ACTH, and CBG levels in CFS patients and healthy matched controls.</E></TI><TGP FILE="G8TT1"></TB>
<P>Correlation plots between total and free cortisol and between ACTH and free or total cortisol were made to study the relation between the several hormones involved in the HPA axis. As shown in <LK IDREF="F1-8">Figure 1A</LK>, a positive correlation was observed between ACTH and total cortisol both in patients &lpar;<E T="I">R</E> &equals;0.597, <E T="I">P</E> &lt;0.001&rpar; and controls &lpar;<E T="I">R</E> &equals;0.596, <E T="I">P</E> &lt;0.001&rpar;. <LK IDREF="F1-8">Figure 1B</LK> also demonstrates a positive correlation between ACTH and free cortisol in patients &lpar;<E T="I">R</E> &equals;0.741, <E T="I">P</E> &lt;0.001&rpar; and in controls &lpar;<E T="I">R</E> &equals;0.429, <E T="I">P</E> &lt;0.02&rpar;.</P>

<LV2><HD>Increased Sensitivity of PBMC to Glucocorticoids in CFS Patients</HD>
<P>Because lymphocytes from CFS patients appeared to have an increased sensitivity to GC in vitro,<LK IDREF="R17-8">17</LK> we randomly selected 15 CFS patients and their matched controls in order to investigate their sensitivities to GC in vitro. PBMC of the patients and controls were stimulated with PHA in the presence of various concentrations of DEX or HC to establish their in vitro responsiveness to GC.</P>
<P>The in vitro proliferation of the PBMC was comparable between patients &lpar;8785&plusmn;2732 cpm&rpar; and controls &lpar;8073&plusmn;2755 cpm&rpar;. Nevertheless, as shown in <LK IDREF="F2-8">Figure 2</LK>, the in vitro proliferation of the PBMC from CFS patients was more sensitive to DEX when compared with the cells from the controls. Moreover, the patients also showed an increased sensitivity to HC. Addition of 0.01 &mgr;mol&sol;L HC to the cultures suppressed the proliferation of PBMC in the CFS patients by 24&percnt; as compared with 10&percnt; suppression in the controls &lpar;<E T="I">P</E> &lt;0.05, Wilcoxon rank&hyphen;sum test for matched pairs, data not shown&rpar;.</P>
<FG ID="F2-8" FILE="G8FF2"><P><E T="BIT">Figure 2</E> <E T="I">Increased sensitivity of PBMC from CFS patients to DEX as compared with matched controls. The figure represents the proliferation by PBMC from 12 CFS patients and matched controls after stimulation with 1 &mgr;g&sol;mL PHA in the presence of various concentrations of DEX. The results are expressed as percentages of the initial responses to PHA only. The mean proliferation&plusmn;SD of PBMC in the absence of DEX was 8785&plusmn;2732 cpm in CFS patients and 8073&plusmn;2755 cpm in the matched controls. &ast;Wilcoxon rank&hyphen;sum test for matched pairs.</E></P></FG>
<P>As depicted in <LK IDREF="T2-8">Table 2</LK>, CFS patients showed no differences in the production of IFN&hyphen;&ggr;, TNF&hyphen;&agr;, IL&hyphen;4, and IL&hyphen;10, but a trend &lpar;<E T="I">P</E> &equals;0.09, Wilcoxon rank&hyphen;sum test for matched pairs&rpar; toward reduced IL&hyphen;2 production was observed. As is demonstrated in <LK IDREF="T3-8">Table 3</LK>, the increased sensitivity to GC in CFS patients with regard to proliferation was not demonstrated at the level of cytokine production. On the other hand, in accord with findings in the literature,<LK IDREF="R30-8 R32-8 R33-8">30,32,33</LK> IL&hyphen;4 and IL&hyphen;10 were less sensitive to DEX than were IL&hyphen;2, IFN&hyphen;&ggr;, and TNF&hyphen;&agr;. With regard to IL&hyphen;2, it was not possible to calculate an IC50 concentration because the addition of low concentrations of DEX had already suppressed IL&hyphen;2 to levels below the detection limit of the ELISA.</P>

<LV2><HD>No Alterations in Affinity and Number of GR in PBMC of CFS Patients</HD>
<P>From 10 of the 12 patients described above the affinity and number of the GR was studied in order to establish whether the increased suppression of PBMC proliferation by GC is related to an increased number or affinity of the GR in these cells.</P>
<P>In addition, RNA was isolated from PBMC of these patients and controls as well as from 10 additional patients and matched controls to investigate the expression of the GR and the HSP90 by RT&hyphen; PCR.</P>
<P>As shown in <LK IDREF="F3-8">Figure 3</LK>, no differences were detected in the affinity or the number of receptors per cell between CFS patients and matched controls. Moreover, four internal lab controls did not differ in GR affinity and density from the analyzed patients and matched controls &lpar;data not shown&rpar;.</P>
<FG ID="F3-8" FILE="G8FF3"><P><E T="BIT">Figure 3</E> <E T="I">No changes in GR density or affinity in PBMC of CFS patients. Affinity &lpar;A&rpar; and number &lpar;B&rpar; of receptors were determined as described in the Methods section. The mean Kd&plusmn;SD was 12.9&plusmn;8.9 nmol&sol;L in CFS &lpar;n&equals;10&rpar; and 18.8&plusmn;16.2 nmol&sol;L in the matched controls &lpar;n&equals;10&rpar;. The mean number of receptors per cell&plusmn;SD was 4839&plusmn;2834 in the patients and 4906&plusmn;1646 in the matched controls.</E></P></FG>
<P>Likewise, RT&hyphen;PCR revealed no differences in the expression of GR and HSP90 mRNA between PBMC of CFS patients and the matched controls &lpar;data not shown&rpar;.</P>
<P>Taken together these results demonstrate that although no differences were detected in affinity and the number of glucocorticoid receptors per cell, PBMC of CFS patients display an increased sensitivity to GC in vitro.</P></LV2>
<LV2><HD>Addition of PMA Renders Cells Resistant for Dexamethasone</HD>
<P>The increased sensitivity of CFS patients for GC, in the absence of an increased affinity or density of the GR, suggests an increased suppression of transcription factors by activated GR in PBMC of CFS patients. Several researchers<LK IDREF="R34-8 R35-8">34,35</LK> have demonstrated that an impaired interaction between the GR and the transcription factor AP&hyphen;1, or overexpression of this transcription factor, rendered cells unresponsive for GC.</P>
<P>In the experimental results displayed in <LK IDREF="F4-8">Figure 4</LK>, the PBMC were stimulated with 0.5 &mgr;g&sol;mL PHA in order to investigate the effects of PMA on the inhibitory effects of DEX. Also, under these circumstances the in vitro PBMC proliferation from CFS patients was more sensitive to DEX as compared with the cells from the controls &lpar;<LK IDREF="F4-8">Figure 4</LK>&rpar;. Addition of 0.01 &mgr;mol&sol;L of DEX suppressed the proliferation by 55&percnt; in the patients as compared with 42&percnt; in the controls &lpar;N&equals;10, <E T="I">P</E> &lt;0.05, RW test for matched pairs&semi; <LK IDREF="F4-8">Figure 4</LK>&rpar; As shown in <LK IDREF="F4-8">Figure 4</LK>, addition of PMA &lpar;a strong inducer of AP&hyphen;1&rpar; to the cultures rendered the cells resistant to DEX with regard to proliferation, which is also in agreement with the literature.<LK IDREF="R34-8 R35-8">34,35</LK> Although the patients displayed a increased sensitivity to DEX, the amount of PMA needed to abrogate inhibition of proliferation by DEX did not differ between patients and controls&semi; in both groups, 0.25 ng&sol;mL yielded complete resistance.</P>
<FG ID="F4-8" FILE="G8FF4"><P><E T="BIT">Figure 4</E> <E T="I">Addition of PMA renders lymphocyte proliferation resistant to DEX both in CFS patients and matched controls.

<LV1><HD><E T="B">DISCUSSION</E></HD>
<P>The results presented in this report demonstrate an increased sensitivity to glucocorticoids by the PBMC of CFS patients without evidence for an altered density or affinity of their GR.</P>
<P>The sensitivity to GC is dependent on several factors, such as the affinity and density of the GR,<LK IDREF="R34-8 R36-8 R37-8">34,36,37</LK> the interaction of the GR with transcription factors, and the control of the gene under investigation by a glucocorticoid&hyphen;responsive element.<LK IDREF="R37-8 R38-8 R39-8 R40-8">37&ndash;40</LK> Barnes et al<LK IDREF="R34-8">34</LK> have elegantly demonstrated that all of these mechanisms are involved in steroid&hyphen;resistant asthma. In particular, an impaired interaction between the transcription factor AP&hyphen;1 and the GR appeared to explain steroid resistance in a subset of these patients.<LK IDREF="R34-8">34</LK> Furthermore, upregulation of AP&hyphen;1 levels in vitro rendered lymphocytes insensitive for GC.<LK IDREF="R35-8">35</LK></P>
<P>The fact that PBMC of CFS patients tend to produce less IL&hyphen;2 compared with controls suggests that there is a reduced induction of AP&hyphen;1 by PHA in CFS patients, because AP&hyphen;1 is a dominant transcription factor in the regulation of IL&hyphen;2 expression.<LK IDREF="R32-8">32</LK> The reduced AP&hyphen;1 levels may lead to a reduced buffer capacity in the PBMC of CFS patients for the activated GR and may, therefore, be subsequently responsible for the increased GC sensitivity. In addition, because the increased sensitivity to GC in vitro in CFS patients is not accompanied by alterations at the level of the GR, this suggests disturbances in the interaction between the GR and transcription factors in CFS patients.</P>
<P>To investigate these possibilities, we added PMA to the PBMC cultures. PMA is a potent stimulator of protein kinase C and causes a strong induction of AP&hyphen;1 and to a lesser extent of NFkB, but it is detrimental for the expression of the transcription factor CREB<LK IDREF="R35-8 R40-8">35,40</LK> Addition of PMA to the cultures resulted in a strong induction of IL&hyphen;2 in both patients and controls, but it had no stimulatory effect on the other cytokines. PMA rendered the cells resistant to DEX with regard to proliferation, IL&hyphen;10 production, and to a lesser extent IFN&hyphen;&ggr; production, but TNF&hyphen;&agr; and IL&hyphen;2 remained sensitive. These results demonstrate that multiple mechanisms are involved in the suppressive effects of glucocorticoids on cytokine production and proliferation of lymphocytes.</P>
<P>More PMA was needed to achieve comparable IL&hyphen;2 levels in the PBMC of CFS patients than in the controls, which is supportive of the conception of reduced AP&hyphen;1 levels in CFS patients. To what extent reduced AP&hyphen;1 levels are involved in the difference in GC sensitivity is still unclear, because no differences were found between patients and controls with regard to the resistance&hyphen;inducing capacity of PMA. Moreover, if an increased suppressive effect of the activated GR on AP&hyphen;1 expression was present in the lymphocytes of the CFS patients, PMA should be less capable to induce steroid resistance in the patients. Most likely, addition of PMA is not specific enough to identify subtle changes in GR and transcription factor interactions, because PMA can induce phosphorylation of the GR via activation of protein kinases. Phosphorylation of the GR has been shown to interfere with the transcriptional activity of the GR.<LK IDREF="R37-8 R41-8">37,41</LK> Given these facts, more specific molecular biological methods like electromobility shift assays may be required for proper investigation of the interactions between transcription factors and the GR in CFS patients.</P>
<P>In addition to these arguments, a polymorphism in the GR gene of CFS patients that explains the altered responsiveness to GC cannot be excluded. Huizenga et al<LK IDREF="R42-8">42</LK> have shown that a polymorphism at nucleotide position 1220 is associated with an altered sensitivity to GC. Carriers of this mutation have a higher suppression of cortisol by DEX in vivo. The affinity and number of the GR in the lymphocytes of these mutation carriers were not affected, but they showed a trend toward a higher suppression of proliferation by DEX.<LK IDREF="R41-8">41</LK> Again, this shows that a normal affinity and number of the GR can be associated with an increased sensitivity to GC in vivo or in vitro. It would be of interest, therefore, to investigate whether CFS patients display such polymorphisms of the GR gene in association with the observed increase in GC sensitivity.</P>
<P>If we assume that the responsiveness to GC is comparable in all tissues, then the increased sensitivity to GC that is observed in lymphocytes from CFS patients<LK IDREF="R17-8">17</LK> may be responsible for the moderate dysfunctioning of the HPA axis in CFS patients. CFS patients display a slight hypocortisolism and a blunted cortisol response to a challenge with ACTH or CRH in vivo.<LK IDREF="R20-8 R21-8 R22-8">20&ndash;22</LK> This blunted cortisol response may be the result of increased negative feedback by cortisol on its own production.</P>
<P>We did not observe reduced levels of cortisol in the serum of CFS patients, in contrast to the study by Demitrack et al.<LK IDREF="R20-8">20</LK> This may be explained by the fact that we measured the hormone levels at only one point in time. Admittedly, 24&hyphen;hour urinary cortisol levels are probably more informative in this regard. Nevertheless, it is remarkable that seven CFS patients displayed high free&hyphen;cortisol levels without increased ACTH levels. These seven CFS patients are responsible for the stronger correlation between ACTH and free cortisol in CFS patients as compared with the controls. The relatively high free&hyphen;cortisol levels in these seven CFS patients cannot be explained by reduced CBG levels, because these patients showed no reduction in CBG.</P>
<P>Patients with depression show a dysfunctioning of the HPA axis, which is quite the opposite situation to that found in CFS patients.<LK IDREF="R23-8 R24-8">23,24</LK> Whereas CFS patients tend to show a hypofunctioning of the HPA axis,<LK IDREF="R3-8 R20-8 R21-8 R22-8">3,20&ndash;22</LK> depressed patients display a hyperfunctioning of the HPA axis.<LK IDREF="R23-8">23</LK> The latter category of patients display elevated levels of cortisol that escape DEX suppression, have elevated levels of CRH in their cerebrospinal fluid, and show an increased mRNA expression of CRH as well as a blunted ACTH response to CRH.<LK IDREF="R23-8 R24-8 R43-8 R44-8 R45-8">23,24,43&ndash;45</LK> In depressed patients a reduced number of GR has been demonstrated, so it can thus be hypothesized that a failure in the negative feedback by GC is one of the major reasons for the dysfunctioning of the HPA axis in depression.<LK IDREF="R24-8 R46-8 R47-8">24,46,47</LK></P>
<P>Posttraumatic stress disorder &lpar;PTSD&rpar; patients and fibromyalgia patients, whose disorders are often compared with CFS, show some resemblance to CFS patients in HPA axis activity. Like CFS patients, PTSD and fibromyalgia patients show low, 24&hyphen;hour urinary cortisol levels.<LK IDREF="R25-8 R48-8 R49-8">25,48,49</LK> Furthermore, PTSD patients show exaggerated cortisol responses to a DEX challenge and have increased numbers of GR in their PBMC.<LK IDREF="R50-8">50</LK> In fibromyalgia patients, a modest impairment of the GR has been demonstrated. These patients show a reduced affinity of the GR but have normal responses to GC in vitro.<LK IDREF="R25-8">25</LK></P>
<P>Taken together, impaired GR function can lead to HPA&hyphen;axis abnormalities, which in turn may increase vulnerability to affective disorders, fatigue syndromes, and immune dysfunction.<LK IDREF="R23-8 R51-8 R52-8 R53-8 R54-8">23,51&ndash;54</LK></P>
<P>As suggested above, the increased sensitivity of PBMC from CFS patients to GC may be the result of a decreased buffer capacity of transcription factors like AP&hyphen;1, CREB, or NFkB. However, it should be taken into account that we measured affinity and the number of receptors during steady state conditions of unstimulated PBMC. We know that GC by itself, as well as other soluble factors like the cytokines IL&hyphen;2, IL&hyphen;4, IL&hyphen;10, TNF&hyphen;&agr;, and IFN&hyphen;&ggr;, can influence the affinity and the number of the GR in lymphocytes.<LK IDREF="R36-8 R37-8 R55-8">36,37,55</LK> So, besides altered interactions with transcription factors, the plasticity of the GR may also be abnormal in CFS patients. Because of all of these potential associations, it will be of interest to study GR function in PBMC of CFS patients under influence of such cytokines and after a challenge with GC.</P></LV1>

<LV1><HD><E T="B">INTRODUCTION</E></HD>
<P>Hypoglycemia is a common metabolic concern in primary care medicine. Because the brain is dependent upon the oxidation of glucose for its metabolic needs, symptoms of brain glucose deprivation occur when the blood glucose concentration falls below some nominal threshold in any given individual. A low blood glucose concentration by itself, however, is insufficient to constitute a diagnosis of hypoglycemia. A clinical diagnosis of hypoglycemia is classically made by identifying the constellation of conditions first elaborated by Whipple<LK IDREF="R1-9">1</LK> in 1938&colon; &lpar;i&rpar; neurologic symptoms of hypoglycemia &lpar;ie, confusion, altered behavior or mental status, coma&rpar;, &lpar;ii&rpar; a simultaneous low blood glucose concentration, and &lpar;iii&rpar; a rapid relief of symptoms following administration of exogenous carbohydrate. Because the symptoms that occur during hypoglycemia are common and can be attributed to myriad other causes, and because the presence of Whipple's triad is difficult to confirm in the clinical setting, the medical evaluation of patients with low plasma glucose concentrations can be a painstaking, subtle, and difficult process.</P>
<P>We report a case of reduced plasma glucose concentrations in the absence of signs or symptoms of hypoglycemia. The data presented suggest a reduced set point for glucose homeostasis and a variant of normal glucose homeostasis manifesting as chronic, persistent glucopenia. The diagnostic approach and reasoning process presented here is typical of that employed during the evaluation of this common clinical problem.</P>
<LV2><HD>Case Report</HD>
<P>A 39&hyphen;year&hyphen;old white female was referred for evaluation of her chronic and persistent low blood sugar during the past 5&hyphen;10 years. She reported numerous instances of low plasma glucose concentrations during office visits to her primary care physician &lpar;range, 35&hyphen;45 mg&sol;dL&rpar;. She only rarely experienced symptoms of shaking, sweating, and confusion, and these had not been clearly related to her blood sugar level. Her past medical history included congenital hip dysplasia, peptic ulcer disease, and irritable bowel syndrome. Current medications included dicyclomine, furosemide, and cimetidine. She had no children and no family history of hypoglycemia or diabetes. She denied alcohol or tobacco use.</P>
<P>Physical examination revealed an apparently healthy young female with a normal body habitus. Blood pressure was 119&sol;68 mm Hg, heart rate was 68 beats per minute, body temperature was 36.5&deg;C, and body weight was 60 kg. The patient's physical examination was unremarkable except for a II&sol;VI systolic murmur at the left upper sternal boarder without radiation. There was no organomegaly.</P>
<P>Initial laboratory studies from the referring physician showed a fasting plasma&hyphen;glucose level of 39 mg&sol;dL &lpar;reference range, 65&hyphen;120 mg&sol;dL&rpar; with a concomitant serum insulin level of 8 &mgr;U&sol;mL &lpar;reference range, &lt;20 &mgr;U&sol;mL&rpar; and a serum C&hyphen;peptide concentration of 0.88 ng&sol;mL &lpar;reference range, 0.50&hyphen;2.00 ng&sol;mL&rpar;. A urine sulfonylurea screen was negative. Adrenal insufficiency was ruled out with a normal response to ACTH&hyphen;stimulation testing.<LK IDREF="R2-9">2</LK> The poststimulation peak cortisol concentration was 24 &mgr;g&sol;dL &lpar;reference range, &gt;20 &mgr;g&sol;dL&rpar;. An abdominal computed tomography scan with contrast showed a homogeneous soft tissue mass arising from the uterus or the right ovary measuring 2.0x2.5x4.0 cm. The pancreas was normal. Subsequent pelvic ultrasound demonstrated a normal uterus and right ovary, which measured 2.2x1.7x1.7 cm, and the pelvic mass was no longer apparent on repeated abdominal computed tomography scan 4 months after the original.</P></LV2></LV1>
<LV1><HD><E T="B">METHODS</E></HD>
<P>Given this initial presentation, we hypothesized that this patient possessed a set point error of glucose homeostasis that resulted in chronic, asymptomatic hypoglycemia. Such a metabolic error would be expected to cause &lpar;i&rpar; chronic glucopenia without symptoms during a prolonged fast, &lpar;ii&rpar; an appropriate suppression of endogenous C&hyphen;peptide during symptomatic hypoglycemia that is precipitated by exogenous insulin, as well as &lpar;iii&rpar; a regulated, incremental secretion of endogenous insulin in response to subtle fluctuations in plasma glucose concentration that are produced by exogenous glucose infusion. A series of experiments was performed at the University of New Mexico General Clinical Research Center to test these hypotheses. The patient rendered written informed consent for these investigations, as approved by the University of New Mexico Human Research Review Committee.</P></LV1>
<LV1><HD><E T="B">RESULTS</E></HD>
<P>The patient underwent an observed, prolonged fast with serial determination of plasma glucose to demonstrate stable glucopenia in the absence of symptoms. She was admitted to the clinical research center after an overnight fast at home, and plasma glucose concentrations were determined every 30 minutes during the 14th through the 60th hour of continuous fasting. As shown in <LK IDREF="F1-9">Figure 1</LK>, plasma glucose concentrations were consistently in the range of 30&hyphen;45 mg&sol;dL. The patient denied all symptoms of hypoglycemia except hunger during this interval. Upon completion of the fast, the patient ingested a 7&hyphen;kcal&sol;kg meal, as recommended by the American Diabetes Association.<LK IDREF="R3-9">3</LK> Blood was sampled for plasma glucose and serum insulin every 30 minutes for an additional 2 hours. Peak postprandial glucose concentration was 126 mg&sol;dL 90 minutes after meal ingestion, and peak serum insulin was 160 &mgr;U&sol;mL 60 minutes after meal ingestion. The patient was then allowed to go home.</P>
<FG ID="F1-9" FILE="G9FF1"><P><E T="BIT">Figure 1</E> <E T="I">Plasma glucose concentrations during a 60&hyphen;hour fast in a healthy young woman with chronic, asymptomatic glucopenia.</E></P></FG>
<P>To rule out the presence of an insulinoma, the patient subsequently participated in a test of C&hyphen;peptide suppression in an attempt to demonstrate an appropriate suppression of endogenous insulin secretion during symptomatic hypoglycemia induced by exogenous insulin, as previously described.<LK IDREF="R4-9">4</LK> As shown in <LK IDREF="F2-9">Figure 2A</LK>, plasma glucose concentration decreased from 57 mg&sol;dL to 20 mg&sol;dL after the intravenous administration of 0.15 U&sol;kg of regular human insulin, and serum C&hyphen;peptide decreased from a baseline of 2.2 ng&sol;mL to 1.4 ng&sol;mL by 20 minutes after injection of the insulin bolus. Intravenous dextrose was administered immediately upon development of symptomatic hypoglycemia. Symptoms specifically included tachycardia, tremulousness, profuse sweating, and a decreased level of consciousness. The study was discontinued when the patient was unable to serially subtract 7 from 100 accurately. Serial determination of counterregulatory hormones during this episode of symptomatic hypoglycemia revealed an appropriate increase in all of the hormones known to be involved in the acute response to hypoglycemia, which ruled out counterregulatory hormone deficiency as a cause for this patient's low plasma glucose &lpar;<LK IDREF="F2-9">Figure 2B</LK>&rpar;.</P>
<FG ID="F2-9" FILE="G9FF2"><P><E T="BIT">Figure 2</E> <E T="I">&lpar;A&rpar; Plasma glucose and C&hyphen;peptide concentrations in response to the administration of an intravenous bolus of insulin, and &lpar;B&rpar; counterregulatory hormone responses to insulin&hyphen;induced hypoglycemia in a healthy young woman with chronic, asymptomatic glucopenia.</E></P></FG>
<P>Finally, a sequential, stepped infusion of glucose was performed to demonstrate an incremental secretion of endogenous insulin in response to minimal increases in plasma glucose concentration. During this study, the patient received the following intravenous infusions&colon; 0.45 mol&sol;L saline at 60 mL&sol;h for 40 minutes&semi; followed by 10&percnt; dextrose at 60 mL&sol;h for 40 minutes&semi; followed by 10&percnt; dextrose at 120 mL&sol;h for 40 minutes&semi; and followed finally by 0.45 mol&sol;L saline at 120 mL&sol;h for 40 minutes. Blood was sampled for determination of plasma glucose and serum insulin from the contralateral arm at 0, 10, 20, 30, 35, and 40 minutes of each sequential infusion step. As shown in <LK IDREF="F3-9">Figure 3A</LK>, plasma glucose concentrations increased incrementally during each of the two dextrose infusions. Results from each infusion step were compared using the paired Student's <E T="I">t</E> test and revealed significant increases in plasma glucose during each incremental step of dextrose infusion that were accompanied by similar incremental increases in serum insulin concentration. Importantly, plasma glucose and serum insulin concentrations returned rapidly to baseline upon cessation of dextrose infusion during the second saline infusion step &lpar;<LK IDREF="F3-9">Figure 3B</LK>&rpar;.</P>

<LV1><HD><E T="B">DISCUSSION</E></HD>
<P>Clinically significant hypoglycemia is a difficult diagnosis to make in the absence of symptoms. When statistically derived population norms are applied to plasma glucose concentrations, it is important to note that adult men and women respond differently to prolonged fasts. Merimee and Tyson<LK IDREF="R5-9">5</LK> have demonstrated that premenopausal women can have nadir plasma glucose concentrations as low as 30&hyphen;35 mg&sol;dL during the first 24 hours of a 72&hyphen;hour fast in the absence of symptoms, and further, that no lower limit normal value for plasma glucose could be established after 48 or 72 hours of fasting because of the wide variation present in this parameter. In adult men, normal fasting glucose concentrations were found to be &gt;55 mg&sol;dL at the end of 24 hours of fasting and greater than 50 mg&sol;dL after 48 and 72 hours of fasting.<LK IDREF="R5-9">5</LK> Physiologists define hypoglycemia as inadequate delivery of glucose to the brain because this organ is most sensitive to an acute fall in blood glucose concentration. In a person with normal cardiac output, neurological symptoms usually occur at a plasma glucose level below 40&hyphen;50 mg&sol;dL.<LK IDREF="R6-9">6</LK> When a physician is confronted with evaluating a patient with a possible history of clinically significant hypoglycemia, however, Whipple's criteria should be rigorously applied whenever possible.<LK IDREF="R1-9">1</LK></P>
<P>The differential diagnosis of fasting hypoglycemia is extensive and includes insulinoma, factitious hypoglycemia induced by insulin or sulfonylureas, intense exercise, starvation, and drugs. Drugs that have been implicated in the pathogenesis of hypoglycemia include alcohol, salicylates, quinidine, pentamidine, and disopyramide. The patient presented in this report was not taking any of these medications and denied alcohol use. Further, serum insulin concentrations were not disproportionately elevated relative to C&hyphen;peptide concentrations during hypoglycemia, ruling out the inappropriate use of exogenous insulin as a cause of her hypoglycemia, and a urine sulfonylurea screen was negative. Other potential causes of hypoglycemia, such as liver disease, kidney disease, sepsis, Addison disease, counterregulatory hormone insufficiency, hypothyroidism, and non&hyphen;islet&hyphen;cell tumors must also be considered in the diagnostic evaluation of reduced plasma glucose concentrations, but these conditions were not apparent in the patient presented here. A differential diagnosis of true hypoglycemia is presented in <LK IDREF="T1-9">Table 1</LK>.</P>
<TB ID="T1-9"><TI><E T="BIT">Table 1 Differential diagnosis of possible causes of hypoglycemia.</E></TI><TGP FILE="G9TT1"></TB>
<P>In an otherwise healthy fasting adult, the appearance of neurologic symptoms suggests that inappropriate hyperinsulinemia is present and that the hypoglycemia is reflecting a serious underlying metabolic disorder. Inappropriate hyperinsulinemia promotes utilization of glucose and ketones in peripheral tissues, resulting in the eventual development of brain glucose deficiency and the appearance of neurological symptoms. Inappropriate hyperinsulinemia during a fast also results in a double insult to the delivery of metabolic fuel to the brain by inhibiting both hepatic glucose production and peripheral lipolysis, thereby reducing substrate availability for ketogenesis. The patient presented in this report did not exhibit inappropriate hyperinsulinemia during a prolonged fast and remained asymptomatic.</P>
<P>Because this patient had a long history of persistent glucopenia, the possible presence of an insulinoma must be entertained. This possibility is discounted by demonstrating an appropriate suppression of C&hyphen;peptide 20 minutes after the injection of an intravenous insulin bolus, which strongly argues against the presence of such a tumor in the present report.<LK IDREF="R4-9">4</LK> Suppression of C&hyphen;peptide concentrations by nearly 50&percnt; after such a short interval is consistent with nearly complete suppression of endogenous C&hyphen;peptide release, because the elimination half&hyphen;life of C&hyphen;peptide is &ap;30 minutes.<LK IDREF="R7-9">7</LK> Moreover, our patient does not exhibit pancreatic abnormalities on computed tomography scanning, and her clinical course is not consistent with the presence of insulinoma.<LK IDREF="R8-9">8</LK> Additionally, the presence of a normal counterregulatory hormone response to insulin&hyphen;induced hypoglycemia in this case rules out counterregulatory hormone insufficiency as a cause of this patient's glucopenia. The failure of cortisol to increase appreciably during insulin&hyphen;induced hypoglycemia is not surprising given that cortisol does not play an important role in the acute response to hypoglycemia.<LK IDREF="R9-9">9</LK> Clinical tests of the competence of the pituitary&hyphen;adrenal axis that assess the cortisol response to hypoglycemic stress require that subjects exhibit a plasma cortisol concentration of greater than 20 &mgr;g&sol;mL at some point during testing, and this patient met that criterion.<LK IDREF="R10-9">10</LK> Normal counterregulatory hormone responses to hypoglycemia are well established for nondiabetic subjects.<LK IDREF="R11-9">11</LK></P>
<P>Appropriate incremental increases in endogenous insulin secretion in response to modest increases in plasma glucose concentration, combined with the return of insulin concentrations to baseline following cessation of the stimulus, strongly suggest that this patient is exhibiting normal glucose homeostasis. It should also be noted that this patient secretes insulin in response to plasma glucose levels that would be considered to be in the &ldquo;hypoglycemic range&rdquo; for a normal healthy person. These data suggest that this young woman possesses a reduced set point around which plasma glucose concentrations are regulated and glucose homeostasis is maintained, resulting in persistently decreased plasma glucose concentrations in the setting of otherwise appropriate insulin secretory dynamics. Whether this condition exists in other patients who experience chronic glucopenia is not currently known, but given that set point alterations have been described that result in chronic, mild hyperglycemia &lpar;eg, maturity onset diabetes of the young&rpar;, it seems reasonable that similar set point errors might exist that result in chronically low blood glucose concentrations.<LK IDREF="R12-9">12</LK> This report constitutes the first known report in the medical literature about a patient with chronic glucopenia who has been demonstrated to possess a reduced set point for glucose homeostasis. Although the term &ldquo;pseudohypoglycemia&rdquo; has previously been used to describe low plasma glucose concentrations that occur because of the occurrence of glycolysis in vitro after blood sampling, this term might also apply to patients with a reduced set point for glucose homeostasis.<LK IDREF="R13-9">13</LK></P>
<P>We conclude that the patient presented here does not have a pathological cause for her chronic and persistently depressed plasma glucose concentrations, and furthermore, that she demonstrates features of a reduced set point for glucose homeostasis that is within the spectrum of normal for a healthy, premenopausal woman. Although this patient presented with an apparently alarming history of chronic hypoglycemia that would represent a difficult diagnostic challenge to most physicians, the evaluation process in this case was facilitated by maintenance of a broad differential diagnosis and an organized, systematic approach to evaluation. The possibility of a set point error in glucose homeostasis should be considered in the evaluation of young women with otherwise unexplained low plasma glucose concentrations, especially when exogenous factors such as drugs and toxins have been excluded.</P></LV1></BD>

<P><E T="I">Purpose&colon;</E> The purpose of this Request for Application &lpar;RFA&rpar; is to develop novel technologies for capturing, enriching, and preserving exfoliated abnormal cells in body fluids or effusions and to develop methods for concentrating the enriched cells for biomarker studies. In body fluids, such as sputum, the number of exfoliated tumor cells is often small compared to the number of non&hyphen; neoplastic cells. Therefore, the detection of exfoliated abnormal cells by routine cytopathology is often limited because few atypical cells may be present in the specimen. Furthermore, there may be difficulty in separating dysplastic cells from non&hyphen;specific reactive changes and degenerating cells or variation in diagnostic criteria. Furthermore, exfoliated cells are frequently contaminated with normal cells, bacteria, and other cellular debris, which makes molecular analysis difficult without physical separation of the neoplastic cells. Thus, the development of enrichment methods is a prerequisite for the routine detection of small numbers of exfoliated cells and small amounts of subcellular materials in biological fluids for molecular analysis.</P>

<P><E T="I">Purpose&colon;</E> This RFA is a part of the National Institutes of Health&hyphen;wide initiative to eliminate health disparities in racial and ethnic minority populations. It builds on the National Institute on Drug Abuse's &lpar;NIDA&rpar; efforts over the past several years to understand better and address drug abuse and addiction among and across racial and ethnic minority populations. It is designed to stimulate epidemiological, prevention, treatment, and services research that addresses issues relating to the differential drug use patterns and&sol;or their associated behavioral, social, medical, and mental health consequences within and across racial and ethnic minority populations. For purposes of this announcement, health disparities research is defined as research that addresses differential incidence and prevalence rates of drug use and its adverse behavioral, social, and health consequences among and across racial and ethnic minority populations. This RFA encourages multidisciplinary research that expands scientific understanding of the etiology of drug use and progression to addiction in racial and ethnic minority populations and the relationship between drug use and its adverse behavioral, social, and health consequences. The overall intent of this announcement is four&hyphen;fold&colon; 1&rpar; to build a theoretical framework to further understand the phenomenon of disparities in drug use and its associated adverse behavioral, social, and health outcomes within and across racial and ethnic minority populations, 2&rpar; to develop an understanding of within and across group drug related health disparities, 3&rpar; to develop and evaluate prevention and intervention strategies aimed at reducing and eliminating drug&hyphen;related health disparities across and within racial and ethnic populations&semi; and 4&rpar; to understand how the management of resources and organization of community, public and private health systems impacts upon the access to and utilization and retention of racial and ethnic minority populations in drug abuse prevention treatment services.</P>

<P><E T="I">Purpose&colon;</E> The National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases &lpar;NIDDK&rpar; invites cooperative agreement applications for a Coordinating Center to support clinical trials for the primary prevention and treatment of type 2 diabetes in children in the U.S. and Canada. Type 2 diabetes has been traditionally viewed as a disease of adults. Recent epidemiological data reveals an increasing number of cases of type 2 diabetes in the pediatric population, especially among adolescents and in certain minority populations. The rise in type 2 diabetes in children and adolescents is presumed to be a consequence of widespread obesity and decreased physical activity. Clinical trials to develop effective primary prevention strategies for this age group are needed. In addition, the drugs currently available for the treatment of type 2 diabetes in adults have not been used widely in children and need to be studied in this population. A complementary RFA &lpar;DK&hyphen;01&hyphen;010&rpar; is being issued to solicit applications for clinical trials for the prevention and treatment of type 2 diabetes in the pediatric population. The intent of this RFA is to create a Coordinating Center &lpar;CC&rpar; to provide clinical center coordination and analytical and statistical support for the clinical trials. In addition, the CC will work with the NIDDK and the clinical centers as part of a Steering Committee to design the actual trial protocols. An institution or organization can apply to be the CC, as well as submit a proposal for a clinical trial. Separate applications are required for these components, which must be administratively and fiscally distinct.</P>
<P><E T="I">Term&sol;Amount&colon;</E> This collaborative effort will be divided into three phases 1&rpar; planning, 2&rpar; recruitment and study, and 3&rpar; analysis. It is anticipated that the planning phase will take 12 months, and &dollar;1.25 million is available to support the Coordinating Center during the first year. Substantially greater funds will be available in subsequent years to support the conduct of the trials. The exact dollar amount will depend, in part, on the final design of the trials. Costs are expected to decrease in the final year of each trial, which will be devoted to data analysis and reporting of results. It is anticipated that one award for the Coordinating Center will be made and that 6&hyphen;10 awards for clinical trial sites will be made. The CC budget for personnel, supplies, equipment, communications, and travel should not exceed &dollar;1.25 million in total costs during the first year. After the planning phase, awards in subsequent years will depend on the requirements of the specific studies designed by the Steering Committee. The CC will receive funds to support its personnel, supplies, equipment, communication, and travel. In addition, it will receive money to pay for centralized laboratories and reading centers, as needed by the trials. Although this program is provided for in the financial plans of the NIDDK, awards pursuant to this RFA are contingent upon the availability of funds for this purpose. Awards and level of support depend on receipt of a sufficient number of applications of high scientific merit.</P>

<P><E T="I">Purpose&colon;</E> The National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute &lpar;NHLBI&rpar; invites applications for support as Comprehensive Sickle Cell Centers that will offer interactive, state&hyphen;of&hyphen;the&hyphen;art programs in basic and translational sickle cell disease research. The primary objective of this Request for Applications &lpar;RFA&rpar; is to support ten Comprehensive Sickle Cell Centers, and a Statistics and Data Management Center, to carry out research focused on the development of cures or significantly improved treatments for sickle cell disease. This research will include basic research efforts, inter&hyphen;center collaborative clinical research, and local clinical research, with all three focused on the most promising therapeutic modalities on the horizon today, and each interactive with the others. In addition to their primary focus in research, Comprehensive Sickle Cell Centers will also support career development of young investigators in sickle cell disease research, and support patient service activities that are focused on the implementation into clinical practice of the best current models of care and treatment for sickle cell disease.</P>
<P><E T="I">Term&sol;Amount&colon;</E> The NHLBI intends to commit approximately &dollar;22,000,000 in FY 2003 to fund ten grants for Comprehensive Sickle Cell Centers, one new grant for a Statistics and Data Management Center, and per&hyphen;patient costs for inter&hyphen;Center collaborative clinical studies in response to this RFA. Comprehensive Sickle Cell Center applicants may request a project period of five years and a budget for total costs &lpar;direct costs plus facilities and administrative &lpar;F&amp;A&rpar; costs&rpar; of up to &dollar;1,770,000 per year. Because the nature and scope of the research proposed may vary, it is anticipated that the size of each award will also vary. Statistics and Data Management Center applicants may request a project period of up to five years and a budget for total costs &lpar;direct costs plus facilities and administrative &lpar;F&amp;A&rpar; costs&rpar; of up to &dollar;700,000. Statistics and Data Management Center applications must be submitted separately from Comprehensive Sickle Cell Center applications. In addition to the &dollar;1,770,000 in total costs per year that may be requested in the application, approximately &dollar;3,600,000 of additional total costs per year will be available program&hyphen;wide for reimbursement of Comprehensive Sickle Cell Centers based on patient entry into inter&hyphen;Center collaborative clinical studies &lpar;see Program Structure below for additional funding caps for required program components&rpar;. Although the financial plans of the NHLBI provide support for this program, awards pursuant to this RFA are contingent upon the availability of funds. Requests for expensive pieces of equipment that cause the application to exceed the budget limits cited above will be considered on an individual basis. However, applicants should make every attempt to include all equipment in the ceiling amount and must discuss any equipment requests that cause the application to exceed the ceiling with NHLBI staff early in the planning phase of the application.

The purposes of this program initiative are to&colon; &lpar;1&rpar; foster the development of independent investigators in nursing research on the faculties of TMBIs and majority academic institutions&semi; &lpar;2&rpar; stimulate nursing research and nursing research training at these institutions&semi; and &lpar;3&rpar; encourage the development of qualified minority nurse investigators in academic research settings who can become effective role models for minority students.</P>
<P><E T="I">Term&sol;Amount&colon;</E> The estimated funds available for the first year of support for the program are expected to be &dollar;320,000 in Fiscal Year 2001. NINR anticipates funding up to four awards in FY 2001. Salary support for each recipient will be for a maximum of &dollar;50,000 plus fringe benefits with a minimum of 75&percnt; effort committed. Each year up to &dollar;20,000 may be requested for research development support. An applicant may request a project period of up to three &lpar;3&rpar; years. Although the financial plans of the IC&lpar;s&rpar; provide support for this program, awards pursuant to this RFA are contingent upon the availability of funds and the receipt of a sufficient number of meritorious applications. At this time, it is not known if this RFA will be reissued.</P>
